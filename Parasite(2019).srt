1
00:01:38,246 --> 00:01:39,855
We're screwed.

2
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:41,590
No more free Wi-Fi.

3
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:44,026
Hey, Ki-jung!

4
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:45,194
Yeah?

5
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:49,365
The lady upstairs
put a password on 'iptime'.

6
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:51,200
A password?

7
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:52,934
Did you try 123456789?

8
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:54,078
No luck.

9
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:55,579
Do it the other way.

10
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,081
I tried that too!

11
00:01:57,182 --> 00:02:01,418
Fuck, then we can't get WhatsApp?

12
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,694
Nothing.

13
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:05,489
Hey, Jim Ki-taek.

14
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:09,493
Don't fucking pretend to sleep.
What do you think?

15
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:16,083
Our phones are shut off.
Now our Wi-Fi is shut off.

16
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:19,711
What's your plan?

17
00:02:21,998 --> 00:02:23,232
- Ki-woo.
- Yes, Dad?

18
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:27,260
For Wi-Fi, held it high.

19
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,474
Stick it in every corner
and so on.

20
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:40,065
Damn stink bugs.

21
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,793
Over here! I got it!

22
00:02:42,894 --> 00:02:44,211
Really? You got a signal?

23
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:46,130
Yeah, see?

24
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:48,882
This one,
'coffeeland 2G'

25
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:50,968
Did a new cafe open?

26
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:52,678
Why can't I get it?

27
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:54,388
Climb up here.

28
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:55,789
Hey kids.

29
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:58,183
- Does it work?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:58,284 --> 00:03:00,836
Then check WhatsApp.

31
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:03,713
Pizza Generation
said they'd contact me.

32
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:05,632
Hold on.

33
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:08,510
Here it is.
Pizza Generation.

34
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:15,284
Wow!
Check this out, guys.

35
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:18,579
If we go as fast as her,
we can finish today.

36
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,913
Then we can get paid.

37
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:23,483
- Should we stand up too?
- She's a pro.

38
00:03:23,643 --> 00:03:26,611
What? Fumigation?

39
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:29,757
They still do that kind of thing?

40
00:03:29,858 --> 00:03:30,799
Guess so.

41
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,675
Shut the window.

42
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:34,261
Leave it open.
We'll get free extermination.

43
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:36,054
Kill the stink bugs.

44
00:03:36,155 --> 00:03:39,040
Right, too many
stink bugs these days...

45
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:43,461
God, that smells!

46
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:47,733
I told you to shut it!

47
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,926
Should I shut it, Dad?

48
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:02,564
What exactly is the problem?

49
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,418
Take this one as an example.

50
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,862
You call this a straight line?

51
00:04:09,397 --> 00:04:11,256
And why's it folded here?

52
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:13,008
Why is this sticking up?

53
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:15,702
You didn't even fold it.

54
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,516
A quarter of them look like this.

55
00:04:20,617 --> 00:04:23,168
So 1 out of 4 are rejects.

56
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:30,217
So you're really docking
10% off our pay?

57
00:04:30,543 --> 00:04:34,221
Considering the rejects
that's a low penalty, isn't it?

58
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:38,350
Our pay is so low already!
How can you do this?

59
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:41,386
Look here.

60
00:04:41,487 --> 00:04:44,289
This is not some minor issue.

61
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:49,444
You know what one shitty boss
can do to our brand image?

62
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:53,198
Brand? You can't even
afford a box folder!

63
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:54,574
What did you say?

64
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,710
Boss.

65
00:04:57,695 --> 00:04:58,929
This is all because
of that guy, right?

66
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,888
What guy?

67
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:03,851
Your part-time worker.
He's gone AWOL, right?

68
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:07,062
Just when the Love of God Church
made a huge group order?

69
00:05:07,163 --> 00:05:10,298
How do you know all that?

70
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,025
Who told you?

71
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:14,111
My sister knows the guy.

72
00:05:14,212 --> 00:05:18,740
He's always been a bit strange.
Got a bad reputation.

73
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:20,934
Speaking of which, Boss.

74
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:23,495
We'll accept a 10% penalty.

75
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:24,580
In return.

76
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:26,022
In return?

77
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:28,667
Any thought of hiring
a new part-time worker?

78
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:32,153
Sis, we need someone!

79
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:36,116
Ditch the guy you've got now.
Just fire him.

80
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:40,036
Tomorrow I'll come for
a formal interview. What time?

81
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:41,663
Wait, hold on a sec.

82
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:44,541
Let me think about it.

83
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:48,378
Then for now,
just pay for the boxes.

84
00:05:54,877 --> 00:05:58,346
So we’re all gathered here today.

85
00:05:58,631 --> 00:06:01,992
To celebrate the
reconnection of our phones,

86
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:05,913
and this bounteous Wi-Fi!

87
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:09,566
Look at that bastard.
It's not even dark yet.

88
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:13,795
Why didn't you put up a
'No Urinating' sign?

89
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:14,546
I told you!

90
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:19,034
No, signs like that just make
them piss even more.

91
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,345
At least shout at him!

92
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:23,079
Don't shout.

93
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:25,332
"Please don't piss!"

94
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:29,961
Hey, is that Min?

95
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:32,564
Hey mister,
that's not a toilet.

96
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:33,982
Way to go, Min

97
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,151
Hey, punk!

98
00:06:36,252 --> 00:06:39,471
Who are you staring at,
asshole?

99
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,141
Come here!
You little shit.

100
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:47,228
Get a fucking grip!

101
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:50,290
That's an impressive friend.

102
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:53,460
College students have
a real vigor to them.

103
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:54,503
Not like my brother.

104
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:58,006
But is he coming here?
Did you invite him?

105
00:06:58,107 --> 00:06:59,207
No.

106
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:00,342
Hello!

107
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:02,077
Oh hi, Min!

108
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,220
Min!

109
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:04,096
Are you well, sir?

110
00:07:04,197 --> 00:07:06,890
- Sure.
- What are you doing here?

111
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:08,583
I texted you.
Didn't you see it?

112
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:10,185
Sorry, were you eating?

113
00:07:10,286 --> 00:07:11,478
No, we weren't eating.

114
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:13,855
- How are you, Ki-jung?
- Fine, you too?

115
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:16,692
We could've met outside,
why come here?

116
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:17,526
Because of this.

117
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:20,487
It's for you,
but it's so heavy.

118
00:07:20,588 --> 00:07:22,889
Really?
Put it down here.

119
00:07:24,926 --> 00:07:26,535
Wow, what is that?

120
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:28,203
When I said I was meeting Ki-woo,

121
00:07:28,304 --> 00:07:31,564
my grandfather insisted
I bring this to you.

122
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:38,279
Is this a landscape type?

123
00:07:39,398 --> 00:07:41,258
Or you can see it as
an abstract type.

124
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:43,051
Wow, you know these!

125
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:47,180
My grandpa has collected
scholar's rocks since his cadet days.

126
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:50,809
Now the annex, the study,
every room in the house

127
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,894
is filled with these things.

128
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:56,857
But this stone here is said to
bring material wealth to families...

129
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,299
Min!

130
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:01,570
This is so metaphorical.

131
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:04,990
For sure.
It's a very opportune gift.

132
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:05,782
Of course.

133
00:08:05,883 --> 00:08:09,936
Please relay our deepest thanks
to your grandpa.

134
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:12,230
Food would be better.

135
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:25,177
What was that called?
A landscape stone?

136
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:26,595
You collect those rocks too?

137
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:31,458
Hey, thanks to that rock I saw
your parents, they look healthy.

138
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:36,963
They're plenty healthy,
just out of work.

139
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,051
Is Ki-jung taking lessons
these days?

140
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:45,638
She can't afford lessons.

141
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:55,857
Cute, huh?

142
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:59,044
She's the one you're tutoring?

143
00:08:59,145 --> 00:09:01,588
Park Da-hye.
High school sophomore.

144
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:05,074
You take over as her English tutor.

145
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:06,343
What do you mean?

146
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:08,953
Tutor a rich kid.
It pays well.

147
00:09:09,989 --> 00:09:11,098
She's a nice girl.

148
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:14,584
Look after her while
I'm studying abroad.

149
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:18,480
What about your
university friends?

150
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:22,175
Why ask a loser like me?

151
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,052
Why do you think?

152
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:26,696
Just the thought makes me sick.

153
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:30,951
Those disgusting frat boys
slavering over Da-hye?

154
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:33,394
It's revolting.

155
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:40,401
You like her?

156
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:47,617
Hey, I'm serious.

157
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:53,039
When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out.

158
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:54,933
So you take care of her
until then.

159
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:59,546
If it's you,
I can leave in peace.

160
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:03,758
Thanks for your trust,

161
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:07,720
but do I have to pretend
to be a college student?

162
00:10:09,257 --> 00:10:12,225
Ki-woo, think about it.

163
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,163
For years including
your military service,

164
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:18,582
you took the university
entrance exam 4 times.

165
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:21,734
Grammar, vocabulary,
composition, conversation...

166
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,753
When it comes to English,

167
00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:28,199
you can teach 10 times better than
those drunken college pricks.

168
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:32,328
- I guess so.
- Sure!

169
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:36,183
But will they hire me?
I'm not a college student.

170
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:37,809
Just fake it.

171
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,046
Don't worry, you'll have
my recommendation, plus...

172
00:10:42,582 --> 00:10:45,758
How should I describe the mother...?

173
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:49,196
She's a bit simple.

174
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:50,447
<i>Young and simple.</i>

175
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:51,681
Simple?

176
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:53,617
What do you mean?

177
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:57,979
Anyway, it's all good.
I had fun there.

178
00:10:58,498 --> 00:10:59,498
So you agree?

179
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:01,399
I guess so.

180
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:06,338
Hey, you said your sister
is artistic?

181
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:10,634
Good at Photoshop?

182
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:14,846
God, with skills like this,
why can't you get into art school?

183
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:16,581
Shut up.

184
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:20,894
Hey, no smoking in here.

185
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:22,395
Yeah, yeah.
Gimme that.

186
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:23,671
Yeah.

187
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:30,970
Now the cherry on top...

188
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:36,910
Wow, does Oxford have a major
in document forgery?

189
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:40,372
Ki-jung would be top of her class.

190
00:11:40,473 --> 00:11:43,166
She's amazing, huh?

191
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:48,780
Our boy's going for a job interview.
Wish him luck.

192
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:50,415
Son.

193
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:54,327
I'm proud of you.

194
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:55,545
Dad.

195
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:59,683
I don't think of this
as forgery or crime.

196
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:01,768
I'll go this university
next year.

197
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:05,355
So you've got a plan!

198
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:09,634
I just printed out
the document a bit early.

199
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:46,087
<i>Who is it?</i>

200
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:48,440
Madame?
Good afternoon.

201
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,317
I'm here on
Min's recommendation...

202
00:12:50,418 --> 00:12:52,552
<i>Oh right, come in.</i>

203
00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:54,687
Thank you.

204
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,879
Hello!

205
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:30,023
Hello, Madame.

206
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:33,551
I just work here.
Come this way.

207
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:35,695
The yard is so nice.

208
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:37,430
The insider's nice too.

209
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:41,250
You know the architect Namgoong?
He's famous.

210
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:44,062
He used to live in this house.

211
00:13:46,223 --> 00:13:48,441
He designed it himself.

212
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:56,449
As you can see,
now it's a playpen.

213
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:58,084
This way.

214
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:02,855
Sit yourself down here.
I'll bring the madame.

215
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:04,056
Yes.

216
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:17,512
Madame.

217
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:19,764
Madame?

218
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:26,771
Madame?

219
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:32,735
He's here.
The tutoring candidate.

220
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:38,491
I don't care about documents.

221
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:41,577
Min recommended you,
after all.

222
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:48,334
As you know, Min is such
a brilliant human being.

223
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:51,104
Da-hye and I were
quite happy with him.

224
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:54,441
Regardless of her grades.
Know what I mean?

225
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:55,642
Yes.

226
00:14:56,168 --> 00:14:57,819
He was marvelous.

227
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,842
So to be honest, we wanted to stick
with him through high school.

228
00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:09,021
But all of a sudden
he's going abroad.

229
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:16,671
Anyway, excuse me,
but if I can speak directly,

230
00:15:16,772 --> 00:15:21,593
if you're not up to
Min's level, then,

231
00:15:21,694 --> 00:15:24,120
I'm not sure what the point is.

232
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:29,893
So anyway,
what I want to say is,

233
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:35,648
for your first lesson today,
do you mind if I sit in.

234
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:39,719
I want to see it full time,
how you run your lesson.

235
00:15:41,755 --> 00:15:43,848
Is it okay with you?

236
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:13,794
You sure about #24?

237
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:26,449
Da-hye, you solved those later
problems then went back to #24.

238
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,225
Right?

239
00:16:29,762 --> 00:16:31,103
Yes.

240
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:44,200
If that were the first question
on a real exam, you'd be screwed.

241
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:48,371
Look at this.
Your pulse is racing.

242
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:54,335
The heart doesn't lie.

243
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:58,439
An exam is like
slashing through a jungle.

244
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,384
Lose that momentum
and you're finished.

245
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:03,903
The answer to #24?
I don't care.

246
00:17:04,004 --> 00:17:09,392
Slashing through the exam,
dominating it!

247
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:11,811
That's all I care about.

248
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:16,565
What you need is vigor.

249
00:17:17,643 --> 00:17:19,026
Vigor.

250
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:21,529
Understand?

251
00:17:32,574 --> 00:17:35,351
So I'll pay you
this time each month.

252
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:38,629
3 classes a week,
2 hours each, okay?

253
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:40,481
As for the fee,

254
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:44,319
I was going to pay Min's rate,
then I added a bit for inflation.

255
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,970
Thank you.

256
00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:49,490
How about a
proper introduction?

257
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:52,518
Da-hye' tutor,
we'll call him Kevin.

258
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:54,895
Mr. Kevin!

259
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:58,791
If you feel like snacking during
your lesson, just call me.

260
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:00,960
If you need anything, ask her.

261
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:03,654
She knows this house
better than I...

262
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:07,241
Da-song, stop it!

263
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:09,052
I'm sorry, did he startle you?

264
00:18:09,153 --> 00:18:11,596
How cute.
His name's Da-song?

265
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:13,514
Yes, our youngest.

266
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:15,141
Da-song, come say hi!

267
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:16,959
This is Mr. Kevin!

268
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:23,566
This is an Indian arrow.
I ordered it from the U.S.

269
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,969
From last year he's been
an Indian fanatic.

270
00:18:29,006 --> 00:18:30,106
Indians?

271
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:33,409
He's got a fanboy personality?

272
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:37,080
Well, he's eccentric
and easily distracted.

273
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:39,982
he can barely sit still!

274
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:42,293
So last year I enrolled him
in Cub Scouts.

275
00:18:42,394 --> 00:18:45,338
hoping he'd learn
moderation and focus.

276
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:46,947
But look.

277
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:49,158
He's even worse.

278
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:56,832
His scout leader is an
Indian fanatic, maybe that's why.

279
00:18:57,367 --> 00:19:01,562
The American Indian is
the very spirit of the Cub Scouts.

280
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:02,605
It's a good thing.

281
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:05,817
Were you a Cub Scout, Kevin?

282
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:09,112
Sure. I'm a Scout by nature.

283
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:13,599
Da-song is an artist by nature.
Look at this painting.

284
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:17,412
It’s so metaphorical.
It's really strong.

285
00:19:17,513 --> 00:19:19,163
Strong, right?

286
00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:21,565
You've got an eye for this.

287
00:19:22,684 --> 00:19:24,168
It's a chimpanzee, right?

288
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:26,028
A self-portrait.

289
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:30,866
Sure enough!

290
00:19:31,902 --> 00:19:35,138
The perspective of a young artist
eludes understanding.

291
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:37,682
Or perhaps it's Da-song's
expressive genius...

292
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:43,229
Anyway, we've been through
so many art teachers.

293
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,589
None of them lasts
even a month.

294
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:50,219
And Da-song is just
so hard to control.

295
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:55,224
- Just a moment. Madame.
- Yes?

296
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,145
Someone just came to mind.

297
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,188
What was her name?

298
00:20:01,723 --> 00:20:04,208
Jessica!
Right, Jessica...

299
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:08,612
She was in the same
art school as my cousin.

300
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,299
What was her Korean name?

301
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,429
Anyway, after studying applied arts
at Illinois State University,

302
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,431
she returned to Korea

303
00:20:18,532 --> 00:20:20,975
Illinois... tell me more.

304
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:27,465
Her teaching is unusual, but she
knows how to handle kids.

305
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,843
She's got a special
reputation in her field.

306
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:33,571
But even though her methods
are unique,

307
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:35,948
she can help kids
get into good art schools.

308
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:40,186
Now I'm really curious.
What is she like?

309
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:42,313
Would you like to meet her?

310
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:45,733
Though I heard
she's in high demand...

311
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:52,823
Hold on.

312
00:20:54,443 --> 00:20:57,929
Jessica, only child,
Illinois Chicago,

313
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,248
classmate Kim Jin-mo,
he's your cousin.

314
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,151
Look at how he painted
the side dishes on the tablecloth

315
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:14,654
in this mosaic arrangement.

316
00:21:14,755 --> 00:21:17,448
But within that too,
there are repeating patterns.

317
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:20,827
Gochujang is red,
the rice... well, anyway,

318
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:25,940
he has a Basquiat-esque sense,
even at age 9!

319
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:28,042
How exciting.

320
00:21:28,143 --> 00:21:33,280
I'm sure Miss Jessica must have
already sensed this,

321
00:21:33,398 --> 00:21:37,451
so I'll leave you two,
and go up for Da-hye's lesson.

322
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,679
Have a nice lesson, Jessica.

323
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,747
Yes, thank you
for the introduction.

324
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:51,298
So as you can see,
Da-song's eccentric genius...

325
00:21:53,835 --> 00:21:54,935
Da-hye.

326
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:58,681
So we'll start with #38?

327
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,245
Kevin.

328
00:22:04,346 --> 00:22:05,563
Yeah?

329
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:10,943
Did you know that
Da-song is faking it all?

330
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:13,671
Huh? What do you mean?

331
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:15,464
It's all a show.

332
00:22:15,565 --> 00:22:19,302
Acting like a genius, that
4th dimension stuff is all fake.

333
00:22:19,403 --> 00:22:21,036
An artist cosplay.

334
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:22,830
Da-song?

335
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:25,600
You know that thing,

336
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:30,087
when he freezes and stares at
the sky, as if struck by inspiration.

337
00:22:30,622 --> 00:22:36,385
So he's walking along, then he
stares at the clouds for 10 minutes.

338
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,571
So you know what I mean?

339
00:22:38,672 --> 00:22:41,240
He gives me the creeps.

340
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:44,768
He pretends that he
can't live a normal life.

341
00:22:45,304 --> 00:22:46,621
Makes me want to puke.

342
00:22:46,722 --> 00:22:49,898
So Da-song is pretending...

343
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:54,653
But what's that got to do with
your studies?

344
00:22:58,692 --> 00:23:02,369
Well, I'm just saying.

345
00:23:04,906 --> 00:23:06,874
Sure, so in that sense,

346
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:12,296
what you told me about Da-song
was very interesting,

347
00:23:12,831 --> 00:23:14,673
so let's write about it in English.

348
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:20,888
And be sure to use the word
'pretend' at least twice.

349
00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:24,367
Then, can I ask you a question?

350
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:25,534
Sure.

351
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:28,103
That teacher Jessica.

352
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:35,736
Is she really
your cousin's classmate?

353
00:23:37,272 --> 00:23:38,839
What do you mean?

354
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,325
She's your girlfriend, right?

355
00:23:44,363 --> 00:23:48,457
No way...
I just met her today.

356
00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:55,506
Jessica's really pretty.
isn't she?

357
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,217
Aren't you interested?

358
00:23:59,252 --> 00:24:00,861
You saw her?

359
00:24:00,962 --> 00:24:05,366
Sure, she's pretty.
She's a beautiful woman.

360
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:06,567
Yeah.

361
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,980
I knew it.

362
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:14,775
So you are interested.

363
00:24:17,312 --> 00:24:18,946
Da-hye...

364
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:27,805
So, if we can compare
Jessica to a rose,

365
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:29,456
then you are...

366
00:25:15,537 --> 00:25:16,896
- Let's study.
- Yes.

367
00:25:16,997 --> 00:25:22,360
Please understand that my boy
has trouble keeping still.

368
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:23,969
I understand.

369
00:25:24,504 --> 00:25:25,604
Da-song!

370
00:25:26,365 --> 00:25:27,365
Da-song, get up!

371
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:29,183
Come on, Da-song!

372
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:31,077
In your butt...

373
00:25:31,178 --> 00:25:34,080
- Madame, please leave us.
- What?

374
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:36,523
I never teach with
a parent in the room.

375
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:39,377
But today is our first day,
and as you can see, he's...

376
00:25:39,478 --> 00:25:41,528
Wait downstairs.

377
00:25:43,006 --> 00:25:44,006
Park Da-song?

378
00:25:44,107 --> 00:25:45,324
Da-song!

379
00:25:49,362 --> 00:25:50,788
Madame?

380
00:25:51,823 --> 00:25:53,140
Want some plum extract?

381
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:54,225
What?

382
00:25:54,326 --> 00:25:57,645
It's mixed with honey.
To ease your tension.

383
00:25:57,746 --> 00:26:00,172
Yeah, that would be great

384
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:16,480
- Hey.
- Yes?

385
00:26:17,015 --> 00:26:18,124
I've got an idea.

386
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:21,485
Take two glasses of plum extract
to Da-song's room.

387
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,755
You're not a parent,
so you can go in!

388
00:26:24,856 --> 00:26:26,298
Oh, that's right!

389
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:29,260
Then I'll report back
on what's going on in there...

390
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:32,079
Why didn't I think of it earlier?

391
00:26:34,346 --> 00:26:35,446
What?

392
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:37,101
They came out?

393
00:26:37,202 --> 00:26:38,752
Yeah.

394
00:26:40,872 --> 00:26:44,049
So you're done already?

395
00:26:45,585 --> 00:26:46,885
Madame.

396
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,388
Come sit next to me.

397
00:26:51,424 --> 00:26:53,058
Da-song, go upstairs.

398
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:56,195
Hurry up!

399
00:27:02,811 --> 00:27:04,712
Da-son just painted this.

400
00:27:04,813 --> 00:27:06,238
I see...

401
00:27:07,774 --> 00:27:10,259
I'd rather speak with
Madame alone.

402
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,510
Oh, but she is...

403
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:14,580
No, leave us.

404
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:24,857
Madame, I told you I study
art psychology and art therapy?

405
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,133
Yes.

406
00:27:27,168 --> 00:27:29,678
Did anything happen to Da-song
in first grade?

407
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:34,683
To be frank,

408
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:38,204
before I decide whether
to take on Da-song,

409
00:27:38,305 --> 00:27:41,064
I need to hear about this.

410
00:27:41,182 --> 00:27:45,177
But this is hard for me
to talk about right now.

411
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:46,128
What to do?

412
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:47,904
Never mind, then.

413
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,385
The lower-right region of a painting
is called the 'schizophrenia zone'.

414
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:55,971
Psychotic symptoms often
reveal themselves here.

415
00:27:56,072 --> 00:27:56,972
Oh, phrenia...

416
00:27:57,073 --> 00:27:58,057
Look here.

417
00:27:58,158 --> 00:28:00,726
Da-song painted this
unusual shape, right?

418
00:28:00,827 --> 00:28:02,044
I see.

419
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:06,941
Over there, it's the same!
It's the same, right?

420
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:09,217
Yes, that's correct.

421
00:28:09,336 --> 00:28:13,030
A similar shape in the same zone.
You see it now?

422
00:28:13,131 --> 00:28:14,389
Yes.

423
00:28:14,924 --> 00:28:19,245
I've stared at that painting
at every meal!

424
00:28:19,346 --> 00:28:21,497
But I had no idea.

425
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:24,733
Calm down.
Let's compose ourselves.

426
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:28,278
This is all a black box
into Da-song's mind.

427
00:28:28,813 --> 00:28:32,574
Would you like to open
that box with me, Madame?

428
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,843
I want to open it.

429
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:39,348
Then we'll need 4
two-hour sessions per week,

430
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:43,686
and this is not simple tutoring,
it's art therapy, right?

431
00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:44,645
Of course.

432
00:28:44,746 --> 00:28:48,632
Because of that my rate is set
at a very high level.

433
00:28:49,234 --> 00:28:50,234
Are you okay with that?

434
00:28:50,335 --> 00:28:52,010
It's my pleasure.

435
00:28:53,546 --> 00:28:55,263
Da-songs dad is home.

436
00:29:01,805 --> 00:29:05,982
Honey, Da-song's new
art teacher is here.

437
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,821
Her name's Jessica,
from Illinois.

438
00:29:11,356 --> 00:29:13,365
Jessica! This is Dong-ik.

439
00:29:13,525 --> 00:29:15,301
- Hello.
- Hi.

440
00:29:15,402 --> 00:29:17,244
Thanks for your help.

441
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,679
Class is over?

442
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,880
Yes, just finished.

443
00:29:20,307 --> 00:29:21,307
- Driver Yoon.
- Yes?

444
00:29:21,408 --> 00:29:22,975
- Are you free?
- Yes, I am.

445
00:29:23,076 --> 00:29:25,644
Then give her a lift, okay?

446
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:30,190
Sure, we don't want her
going down alone at night, right?

447
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:31,550
Of course.

448
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:33,093
Miss Jessica?

449
00:29:33,628 --> 00:29:39,141
Shall I drive you
all the way home, then?

450
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:42,536
- Which neighborhood?
- No. that's fine

451
00:29:42,637 --> 00:29:46,440
You can just drop me off
at Hyehwa station.

452
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:47,583
Thank you.

453
00:29:47,684 --> 00:29:48,959
I don't mind if it's far away.

454
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,255
- My shift is finished, anyway.
- I'll get off at Hyehwa.

455
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:56,783
Looks like it's going to rain.

456
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:00,554
Ride the Benz, not the subway!

457
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:04,124
I'm meeting my boyfriend
at exit 3 of Hyehwa Station!

458
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,760
Yes.

459
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,540
Dad, when you worked as a driver,
did you drive a lot of Benzes?

460
00:30:46,075 --> 00:30:52,422
Benzes? Not then, but I did
when I worked as a valet.

461
00:30:52,957 --> 00:30:55,442
You worked as a valet?

462
00:30:55,543 --> 00:30:59,279
Sure, after the chicken place went bust,
before the Taiwan cake shop,

463
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,198
in that 6-month window?

464
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:05,101
No, it was after
the cake shop went bust.

465
00:31:07,722 --> 00:31:09,898
We're moving to
the next stage already?

466
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:14,044
I set a trap in the Benz.

467
00:31:14,145 --> 00:31:16,029
Then we're diving right in.

468
00:31:16,564 --> 00:31:18,465
Wow this is so metaphorical.

469
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:21,952
Look Dad, we're eating in a
driver's cafeteria right now!

470
00:31:22,737 --> 00:31:24,746
Right, a driver's cafeteria!

471
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:27,141
Eat as much as you want, kids.

472
00:31:27,242 --> 00:31:30,168
You didn't even pay for it.
they did!

473
00:31:30,537 --> 00:31:33,313
Son, have some more.
Eat up!

474
00:31:33,414 --> 00:31:34,231
Yes, Dad.

475
00:31:34,332 --> 00:31:35,357
Eat your fill!

476
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,693
What did you do
to that woman yesterday?

477
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:38,444
What?

478
00:31:38,545 --> 00:31:40,237
She was freaking out.

479
00:31:40,338 --> 00:31:42,681
Saying she was so moved,
you put her in shock.

480
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,158
Fuck. I don't know!

481
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:48,144
I googled 'art therapy'.
and ad-libbed the rest.

482
00:31:48,263 --> 00:31:50,831
Then suddenly she's weeping.

483
00:31:50,932 --> 00:31:53,316
Crazy bitch,
I couldn't believe it.

484
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:28,952
Oh, you're home?

485
00:32:29,053 --> 00:32:30,770
Did you eat yet?

486
00:32:32,557 --> 00:32:34,041
Is something wrong?

487
00:32:34,142 --> 00:32:35,459
Is the housekeeper out?

488
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,611
She's walking the dogs.

489
00:32:38,187 --> 00:32:39,613
Honey.

490
00:32:40,648 --> 00:32:42,866
This was under my car seat.

491
00:32:45,403 --> 00:32:47,621
Driver Yoon is such a scumbag.

492
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,080
What is this?

493
00:32:50,116 --> 00:32:51,350
I'm sorry, honey.

494
00:32:51,451 --> 00:32:53,560
I didn’t know he was
this kind of guy.

495
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:56,755
Don't you pay him well?

496
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,275
Is he saving up by
not paying for a motel?

497
00:33:00,376 --> 00:33:01,818
He must be a pervert.

498
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,195
He likes it in the car.

499
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:07,199
Oh, that's gross.
In his boss' car!

500
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,937
A young guy's sex life is
his own business, that's all fine.

501
00:33:15,475 --> 00:33:17,984
But why in my car?

502
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,048
And if so, why not in his seat?
Why cross the line like that?

503
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:24,699
You're right.

504
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:28,136
Does dripping his sperm
on my seat turn him on?

505
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:30,413
I can't believe this.

506
00:33:34,952 --> 00:33:39,130
But you know what's
strangest of all?

507
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:41,007
What?

508
00:33:42,043 --> 00:33:44,361
Usually if you have car sex,

509
00:33:44,462 --> 00:33:49,741
you might leave behind
a strand of hair, or an earring.

510
00:33:49,842 --> 00:33:50,951
Right.

511
00:33:51,052 --> 00:33:54,896
But how can you forget
your own panties?

512
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:59,317
That's right.
It's hard to overlook.

513
00:34:00,353 --> 00:34:04,614
So it makes me quite suspicious
of this woman's condition.

514
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,866
You get me?

515
00:34:16,452 --> 00:34:18,020
Oh my... meth or cocaine?

516
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:19,838
Shh! The kids...

517
00:34:20,373 --> 00:34:21,565
What do we do?

518
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:24,318
What if anyone finds
white powder in your car?

519
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:27,012
Calm down, relax.

520
00:34:27,547 --> 00:34:29,055
Relax.

521
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,892
For now it's just supposition.
A rational guess.

522
00:34:33,428 --> 00:34:35,078
But no need to call the police.

523
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,022
Not that!

524
00:34:37,598 --> 00:34:43,378
Still, for a busy man like me to ask,
"Why are you fucking in my car?"

525
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:44,588
Exactly.

526
00:34:44,689 --> 00:34:46,506
So instead...

527
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:51,637
Can you just invent some
bland excuse to let him go?

528
00:34:51,738 --> 00:34:53,096
Okay sure.

529
00:34:53,197 --> 00:34:56,558
No need to mention
panties or car sex.

530
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,644
We don't need to stoop
to that level, do we?

531
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:00,754
Surely not!

532
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:04,149
But what if he goes online
and accuses us...

533
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,259
Just give him a good severance.

534
00:35:06,794 --> 00:35:10,072
How was Da-song today?

535
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:12,265
He was fine.

536
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,910
- So class is finished?
- Yes.

537
00:35:15,011 --> 00:35:17,579
Jessica, the last time you came,

538
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,123
our driver gave you a ride, right?

539
00:35:20,224 --> 00:35:21,083
That's right.

540
00:35:21,184 --> 00:35:23,543
This may be an odd question,

541
00:35:23,644 --> 00:35:25,528
but nothing happened then?

542
00:35:25,646 --> 00:35:27,005
No, he was very nice.

543
00:35:27,106 --> 00:35:28,966
I told him to go
to Hyehwa Station,

544
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:32,344
but he insisted on
driving me home.

545
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:35,597
That jerk!
He took you home late at night?

546
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:37,374
Revealing where you live?

547
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:40,686
No, I got off at Hyehwa.

548
00:35:40,787 --> 00:35:43,146
Oh, good girl. Very good.

549
00:35:43,247 --> 00:35:44,815
Jessica nice...

550
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:47,275
Did something happen with him?

551
00:35:47,376 --> 00:35:52,572
He won't be working for us any more.
A slightly shameful incident.

552
00:35:52,673 --> 00:35:54,616
What incident?

553
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:57,685
Oh, you don't need to know.

554
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:02,833
But I'm surprised.
He was so gentlemanly and cool.

555
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:06,253
Jessica, you're too
young and innocent!

556
00:36:06,354 --> 00:36:08,446
You have a lot to learn about people.

557
00:36:09,482 --> 00:36:14,052
But we were excited to have
such a young, hip driver, too.

558
00:36:14,153 --> 00:36:17,347
But isn't an older driver better?

559
00:36:17,448 --> 00:36:21,435
That's true. They drive better,
have better manners.

560
00:36:21,536 --> 00:36:24,187
My father's brother had
a driver just like that.

561
00:36:24,288 --> 00:36:28,734
Mr. Kim.
He was so congenial and nice,

562
00:36:28,835 --> 00:36:31,361
I used to call him Uncle
when I was young.

563
00:36:31,462 --> 00:36:33,447
You know a man like that?

564
00:36:33,548 --> 00:36:36,599
Yes, he was so mild-mannered.

565
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:41,896
Oh, but my relatives
relocated to Chicago.

566
00:36:42,974 --> 00:36:45,167
I wonder if
Mr. Kim's free now?

567
00:36:45,268 --> 00:36:49,254
I'm really interested!
Could I meet him?

568
00:36:49,355 --> 00:36:50,422
Really?

569
00:36:50,523 --> 00:36:52,907
I don't trust anyone now.

570
00:36:53,442 --> 00:36:56,344
I only trust someone recommended
by a person I know well.

571
00:36:56,445 --> 00:37:01,124
But if you've known him so long,
I'd feel much more at ease.

572
00:37:03,703 --> 00:37:05,753
Do you really want to meet him?

573
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:07,797
I'm deadly serious.

574
00:37:08,332 --> 00:37:11,885
This chain of
recommendations is best.

575
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,636
How should I describe it?

576
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:15,221
A belt of trust?

577
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,740
- This one's different.
- Here.

578
00:37:16,841 --> 00:37:17,407
Oh, right.

579
00:37:17,508 --> 00:37:19,142
And this one.

580
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,786
Looks like a touch screen now.

581
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:23,789
It's not touch,
it says you have to turn it.

582
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,940
Wow, this thing?

583
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,375
Sir?

584
00:37:27,476 --> 00:37:29,819
Taking our time, are we?

585
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,246
This is a nice car.

586
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:38,411
This is en
it! Come over here.

587
00:37:42,116 --> 00:37:43,666
He's in a meeting now.

588
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:50,715
Have a seat and wait here.

589
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:02,810
Hello, nice to meet...

590
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:07,415
But is it compatible
with a phone?

591
00:38:07,516 --> 00:38:14,197
Oh, not with a phone.
You need more computing power.

592
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:19,953
This isn't any sort of test,
so don't be nervous.

593
00:38:20,696 --> 00:38:23,748
I was worn out at the office,
so I came out for a bit.

594
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:25,433
I understand.

595
00:38:25,534 --> 00:38:30,129
Constant chatter, all that bother.
At least the car is peaceful.

596
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:33,841
Thank you.

597
00:38:34,877 --> 00:38:36,069
You seem to know
the road well?

598
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:39,489
Anything below the 38th parallel.

599
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,850
After 30 years behind the wheel,
the car almost drives itself.

600
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:46,020
I respect those who work
in one field for a long time.

601
00:38:46,264 --> 00:38:49,249
Well, to be honest
this is a simple vocation.

602
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:52,360
But... the head of a household,

603
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:54,045
the leader of a company?

604
00:38:54,146 --> 00:38:59,659
Or else just a lonely man setting off
on the road each morning...

605
00:39:00,528 --> 00:39:02,287
It's companionship of a sort,

606
00:39:02,446 --> 00:39:05,348
so that's how
I've approached each day.

607
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:07,333
The years sure pass quickly.

608
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:13,673
Sure enough,
your cornering is excellent.

609
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:20,739
Well, it may look simple,
but it's one of the fundamentals.

610
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:25,602
<i>She may look like a sheep,
but inside, she's a fox.</i>

611
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,813
<i>Sometimes she acts like
she owns the house.</i>

612
00:39:29,332 --> 00:39:30,332
<i>Right.</i>

613
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:34,920
<i>Of all the people in that house,
she's lived there the longest.</i>

614
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:38,673
<i>She was housekeeper
to the architect Namgoong,</i>

615
00:39:38,774 --> 00:39:43,453
<i>but then she went on
to work for this family.</i>

616
00:39:43,988 --> 00:39:45,347
<i>When the architect moved out,</i>

617
00:39:45,448 --> 00:39:48,350
<i>he introduced this woman
to Park's family,</i>

618
00:39:48,451 --> 00:39:51,794
<i>telling them, "This is a great
housekeeper, you should hire her."</i>

619
00:39:51,912 --> 00:39:55,232
<i>So she survived
a change of ownership.</i>

620
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:58,384
She won't give up good job easily.

621
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:02,055
To extract a woman like that,
we need to prepare well.

622
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:06,100
Right, we need a plan.

623
00:40:07,136 --> 00:40:10,688
I want to eat peaches.
I like peaches best.

624
00:40:11,223 --> 00:40:12,332
Why not ask for some?

625
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:16,194
No peaches at our house.
It's a forbidden fruit.

626
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:26,721
<i>So according to what
Da-hye told me,</i>

627
00:40:26,822 --> 00:40:31,434
<i>she's got a massively serious
allergy to peaches.</i>

628
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:34,771
<i>You know that fuzz
on a peach's skin?</i>

629
00:40:34,872 --> 00:40:38,483
<i>If she's anywhere near it,
she gets a full body rash,</i>

630
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:42,553
<i>has trouble breathing,
asthma, a total meltdown!</i>

631
00:40:47,093 --> 00:40:51,229
No no, there weren't
any peaches anywhere.

632
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:55,358
That's what I'm saying!

633
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:58,086
Usually when I get
symptoms like this,

634
00:40:58,187 --> 00:41:01,589
I run to my room
and take my medicine,

635
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:07,053
but it was so sudden,
I wasn't sure where I left it.

636
00:41:07,154 --> 00:41:12,183
Madame, this woman
behind me, is that?

637
00:41:12,284 --> 00:41:14,185
Oh, it's our housekeeper!

638
00:41:14,286 --> 00:41:16,938
So it's true.
Oh, how sad.

639
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,025
I wasn't sure if that
was really her.

640
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:23,886
I've only seen her a couple times
in the living room.

641
00:41:24,422 --> 00:41:26,406
This was in the hospital?

642
00:41:26,507 --> 00:41:30,435
A few days ago I went for
my annual medical exam.

643
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,981
I took a selfie for my wife,
and there she was behind me.

644
00:41:35,474 --> 00:41:37,483
Is she talking
on the phone there?

645
00:41:37,685 --> 00:41:42,839
Anyway. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop...

646
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,758
but her words came through clearly!

647
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:46,593
- So I couldn't help but..
- Cut, cut!

648
00:41:46,694 --> 00:41:49,554
Dad, your emotions are up to here.

649
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:51,914
Bring them down to about there.

650
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,893
...so I couldn't help but overhear.

651
00:41:54,994 --> 00:41:57,754
Keep it focused!

652
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,566
What I'm trying to say is,
it's just that,

653
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:05,887
your housekeeper's voice
is quite loud, you know?

654
00:42:06,046 --> 00:42:09,574
I understand, it's all right.
Just tell me, okay?

655
00:42:09,675 --> 00:42:12,494
She said she got diagnosed
with active TB,

656
00:42:12,595 --> 00:42:14,662
and she was shouting
on the phone,

657
00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:17,832
so upset she could
barely control herself!

658
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:20,251
Tuberculosis? Come on...

659
00:42:20,352 --> 00:42:25,698
It's true, she phoned someone
saying she had active TB.

660
00:42:26,233 --> 00:42:30,828
Do people still get TB?

661
00:42:31,022 --> 00:42:32,122
Dad...

662
00:42:32,364 --> 00:42:37,352
Back in the day, people used
to buy Christmas Seals, right?

663
00:42:37,453 --> 00:42:38,770
Feels like a bygone era.

664
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:40,522
But I saw it on the internet.

665
00:42:40,623 --> 00:42:44,442
Korea has the #1 rate of TB
of all the OECD countries.

666
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:48,071
But she's still working,
as if nothing's wrong.

667
00:42:48,172 --> 00:42:50,115
With a kid like Da-song
in the house.

668
00:42:50,216 --> 00:42:53,493
So you've got a young kid
like Da-song in the house,

669
00:42:53,594 --> 00:42:56,830
and a TB patient is doing dishes,
cooking, spraying spittle...

670
00:42:56,931 --> 00:42:58,564
Stop it, please!

671
00:43:02,853 --> 00:43:04,862
Dad: arriving in 3 mins

672
00:43:51,402 --> 00:43:55,413
If you get the chance,
this'll be icing on the cake.

673
00:44:25,603 --> 00:44:27,295
Madame

674
00:44:27,396 --> 00:44:30,781
2nd floor sauna room

675
00:44:40,826 --> 00:44:42,418
- Have a seat
- Yes.

676
00:44:44,563 --> 00:44:45,563
Mr. Kim.

677
00:44:45,664 --> 00:44:49,734
Please don't tell any of this
to my husband, okay?

678
00:44:49,835 --> 00:44:50,860
Understood.

679
00:44:50,961 --> 00:44:55,640
If he hears I brought a
TB patient to our home,

680
00:44:55,799 --> 00:44:58,535
I'll be hanged
and quartered!

681
00:44:58,636 --> 00:45:00,537
Don't worry, Madame.

682
00:45:00,638 --> 00:45:04,249
And if I may presume
to say one thing.

683
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,652
I have no feelings
against that woman.

684
00:45:08,187 --> 00:45:15,276
I felt I had to speak up for the
sake of public health and hygiene

685
00:45:15,653 --> 00:45:19,180
But this could be seen
as snitching or...

686
00:45:19,281 --> 00:45:20,682
Don't you worry.

687
00:45:20,783 --> 00:45:23,351
I won't mention the TB.

688
00:45:23,452 --> 00:45:25,895
I'll just make up some excuse
to dismiss her.

689
00:45:25,996 --> 00:45:27,505
Simply and quietly.

690
00:45:29,124 --> 00:45:31,818
It's a proven method.
That's the best.

691
00:45:31,919 --> 00:45:33,844
Okay, then.

692
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:48,067
Have you...
washed your hands?

693
00:46:33,564 --> 00:46:37,634
Mr. Kim, do you know
a good braised ribs place?

694
00:46:37,735 --> 00:46:39,385
Somewhere close by.

695
00:46:39,486 --> 00:46:40,845
Sure.

696
00:46:40,946 --> 00:46:44,707
- Then you'll be eating out?
- That's right.

697
00:46:45,325 --> 00:46:48,252
Why such a craving for
braised ribs today?

698
00:46:48,787 --> 00:46:51,672
Our old housekeeper made
delicious ribs.

699
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:54,776
The one who quit this week?

700
00:46:54,877 --> 00:46:59,847
My wife wouldn't even
tell me why she quit.

701
00:47:02,468 --> 00:47:07,855
Sure, it's easy enough
to hire a new one.

702
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:13,503
Still, it's a shame.
She was a great housekeeper

703
00:47:13,604 --> 00:47:14,504
I see.

704
00:47:14,605 --> 00:47:17,173
She kept the house
in great shape,

705
00:47:17,274 --> 00:47:19,950
and she knew never to
cross the line.

706
00:47:20,486 --> 00:47:23,370
I can't stand people
who cross the line.

707
00:47:23,906 --> 00:47:26,582
Perhaps just one weak point?

708
00:47:27,201 --> 00:47:28,685
Eating too much.

709
00:47:28,786 --> 00:47:31,712
She always ate enough for two.

710
00:47:32,372 --> 00:47:36,234
But considering
all the work she did...

711
00:47:36,335 --> 00:47:41,698
Then you better find someone new.
A new housekeeper.

712
00:47:41,799 --> 00:47:43,825
We're in trouble now.

713
00:47:43,926 --> 00:47:48,395
In a week,
our house will be a trash can.

714
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:52,441
My clothes will start to smell.

715
00:47:53,477 --> 00:47:56,379
My wife has no talent
for housework.

716
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,782
She's bad at cleaning,
and her cooking's awful.

717
00:48:00,818 --> 00:48:02,701
Still, you love her, right?

718
00:48:10,369 --> 00:48:13,712
Of course.
I love her.

719
00:48:14,748 --> 00:48:16,632
We'll call it love.

720
00:48:18,252 --> 00:48:20,427
Then would this help?

721
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:26,659
The Care?
What is this?

722
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,245
I just recently
found out about them.

723
00:48:29,346 --> 00:48:34,191
How to describe it?
It's like a membership service

724
00:48:34,768 --> 00:48:41,299
The company provides veteran-grade
help to VIP customers such as you.

725
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:47,305
For example maids, caregivers.
or drivers like myself.

726
00:48:47,406 --> 00:48:50,624
You can tell from the card
they're high-class.

727
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:52,751
Cool design.

728
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:55,813
Then how do you
know about this company?

729
00:48:55,914 --> 00:49:00,443
They contacted me
as a veteran-grade driver.

730
00:49:00,544 --> 00:49:02,761
You might say they scouted me?

731
00:49:04,298 --> 00:49:10,036
But when their call came I had
already arranged to meet with you.

732
00:49:10,137 --> 00:49:13,314
I see...

733
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:17,610
You turned down this
famous company to work for me.

734
00:49:18,145 --> 00:49:19,570
I won't forget that.

735
00:49:21,106 --> 00:49:23,324
Son of a bitch!

736
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,222
Anyway, I can give this card
to my wife, right?

737
00:49:29,323 --> 00:49:31,098
Yes, that's why I brought it up.

738
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:33,375
No need to mention me.

739
00:49:34,786 --> 00:49:37,963
You can tell her
you found the company yourself.

740
00:49:38,498 --> 00:49:39,857
Sure.

741
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:42,318
Thanks to you I can
play the good husband.

742
00:49:42,419 --> 00:49:47,198
On the back, there's
a number for consultations.

743
00:49:47,299 --> 00:49:48,449
Tell her to call there...

744
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,100
Eyes on the road!

745
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,359
Hello, this is Senior Advisor Yeo
of The Care.

746
00:49:58,518 --> 00:50:01,987
Yes, this is The Care's main office?

747
00:50:02,773 --> 00:50:06,175
If she wanted, she'd be
a fucking great con artist.

748
00:50:06,276 --> 00:50:08,911
Isn't her voice tone great?
Takes after me.

749
00:50:10,447 --> 00:50:12,974
From what I've heard,
it's a full membership service?

750
00:50:13,075 --> 00:50:16,936
So you're not currently
a member, I assume?

751
00:50:17,037 --> 00:50:19,564
That's right,
What steps do I need to take?

752
00:50:19,665 --> 00:50:23,776
We'll just need to receive
a few documents from you.

753
00:50:23,877 --> 00:50:26,863
Are you ready to write this down?

754
00:50:26,964 --> 00:50:31,850
Your family register,
citizenship ID cards...

755
00:50:32,552 --> 00:50:35,496
documents to prove
your income level,

756
00:50:35,597 --> 00:50:38,040
i.e the title to your property, etc.

757
00:50:38,141 --> 00:50:40,567
Our property title?
Yes.

758
00:50:49,111 --> 00:50:50,428
Wow, peaches!

759
00:50:50,529 --> 00:50:52,663
You have some too, Mr. Kevin.

760
00:50:52,781 --> 00:50:54,123
Thank you.

761
00:51:02,624 --> 00:51:05,651
Leave it outside the door
next time.

762
00:51:05,752 --> 00:51:07,886
- And knock!
- Yes.

763
00:51:10,465 --> 00:51:12,074
No entering during my lesson!

764
00:51:12,175 --> 00:51:13,600
Yes, miss!

765
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:17,079
Park Da-song!

766
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,414
Daddy!

767
00:51:18,515 --> 00:51:19,982
Where are you?

768
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:25,546
Daddy!

769
00:51:25,647 --> 00:51:26,505
Son!

770
00:51:26,606 --> 00:51:29,508
Walkie talkies!

771
00:51:29,609 --> 00:51:30,601
Walkie talkies!

772
00:51:30,702 --> 00:51:33,746
Who do you like better,
your dad or the walkie talkie?

773
00:51:34,081 --> 00:51:37,350
Da-song, how could you
run out from your lesson?

774
00:51:37,451 --> 00:51:41,020
When did you buy all this?

775
00:51:41,121 --> 00:51:42,063
It's no big deal.

776
00:51:42,164 --> 00:51:43,264
Huh?

777
00:51:46,117 --> 00:51:47,348
Huh?

778
00:51:47,859 --> 00:51:49,565
What is it?

779
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:53,557
What's he doing now?

780
00:51:54,393 --> 00:51:55,785
Da-song, don't do that!

781
00:51:55,886 --> 00:51:59,705
It's the same!
They smell the same!

782
00:51:59,806 --> 00:52:03,417
What are you talking about?
Go up to Jessica.

783
00:52:03,518 --> 00:52:07,571
Jessica smells like that, too.

784
00:52:08,607 --> 00:52:11,926
So do we all need to use
different soap, now?

785
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:15,888
Dad, we'll need to use
different laundry soap, too.

786
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:17,098
And fabric softener.

787
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:21,519
You mean doing four separate
loads of laundry each time?

788
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,545
That's not it.

789
00:52:24,164 --> 00:52:26,382
It's the semi-basement smell.

790
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:30,219
We need to leave this home
to lose the smell.

791
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:37,868
Anyway, aren't we fortunate to be
worrying about things like this?

792
00:52:37,969 --> 00:52:38,995
Sure.

793
00:52:39,096 --> 00:52:42,206
In an age like ours,

794
00:52:42,307 --> 00:52:47,003
when an opening for a security guard
attracts 500 university graduates.

795
00:52:47,104 --> 00:52:50,364
Our entire family got hired!

796
00:52:50,899 --> 00:52:52,533
That's right, Dad!

797
00:52:53,068 --> 00:52:55,511
If we put our 4 salaries together?

798
00:52:55,612 --> 00:52:59,957
The amount of cash coming from
that house into ours is immense!

799
00:53:00,534 --> 00:53:05,062
Let's offer a prayer of gratitude
to the great Mr. Park.

800
00:53:05,163 --> 00:53:06,272
And to Min!

801
00:53:06,373 --> 00:53:09,025
Ki-woo, that friend of yours
turned into such a fine guy,

802
00:53:09,126 --> 00:53:13,429
and thanks to him we're all...
Fuck, not again!

803
00:53:17,993 --> 00:53:18,993
That asshole's dead.

804
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:21,620
Ki-woo's on the rampage!

805
00:53:21,721 --> 00:53:24,398
Don't overdo it!

806
00:53:25,433 --> 00:53:27,985
Use this instead.

807
00:53:31,523 --> 00:53:33,157
Damn you!

808
00:53:35,694 --> 00:53:36,927
Get a fucking grip!

809
00:53:37,028 --> 00:53:38,954
Get a grip!

810
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,749
Wow!

811
00:53:46,788 --> 00:53:49,214
It's a deluge!

812
00:54:05,682 --> 00:54:09,460
Current weather is clear, over.
The clouds are moving.

813
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:11,962
But they're not rain clouds, over.

814
00:54:12,063 --> 00:54:13,422
I hear you, over.

815
00:54:13,523 --> 00:54:19,845
Currently your sister's lip
is pouting like a duck's bill.

816
00:54:19,946 --> 00:54:22,932
She's super annoyed, over.

817
00:54:23,033 --> 00:54:27,770
Can't I stay home and study English?
And call Kevin?

818
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:31,232
Hey! Don't make a scene
just as we're leaving.

819
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:33,651
If we have to go,
let's have fun.

820
00:54:33,752 --> 00:54:36,403
Da-hye, this is no
ordinary camping trip.

821
00:54:36,504 --> 00:54:37,238
That's right!

822
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:39,164
How could you miss
your brother's birthday?

823
00:54:39,265 --> 00:54:40,157
No way!

824
00:54:40,258 --> 00:54:42,535
Even your busy father
is taking time off to go.

825
00:54:42,636 --> 00:54:45,562
Right! If you don't go,
you'll regret it!

826
00:54:47,891 --> 00:54:50,042
Oh, right.
You know the beam projector?

827
00:54:50,143 --> 00:54:51,085
The outdoor theater?

828
00:54:51,186 --> 00:54:53,362
Right, bring the outdoor
beam projector.

829
00:54:53,855 --> 00:54:58,342
And look for Da-song's
camping raincoat.

830
00:54:58,443 --> 00:55:00,369
He loves it when it rains.

831
00:55:00,904 --> 00:55:04,598
You remember now?
Zoonie, Berry, and Fofoo.

832
00:55:04,699 --> 00:55:05,766
Zoome and Berry get this.

833
00:55:05,867 --> 00:55:08,686
Yes, Natural Balance Original Ultra.

834
00:55:08,787 --> 00:55:11,255
Right, and for Foofoo...

835
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:12,982
Kam-kamaboko.
Japanese crab sticks.

836
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:14,108
Yes.

837
00:55:14,209 --> 00:55:17,152
When you walk Zoonie,
give him a long leash.

838
00:55:17,253 --> 00:55:19,613
He needs to run around
to feel happy.

839
00:55:19,714 --> 00:55:23,141
He's like the canine version
of Da-song!

840
00:55:48,702 --> 00:55:50,477
Son!

841
00:55:50,578 --> 00:55:53,606
Why are you lying down outside?

842
00:55:53,707 --> 00:55:56,591
Isn't he hot out there?

843
00:55:57,127 --> 00:56:01,847
I'm gazing at the sky from home.

844
00:56:03,383 --> 00:56:04,975
It's so great.

845
00:56:08,513 --> 00:56:10,497
Mom, want some water?

846
00:56:10,598 --> 00:56:12,041
There's sparkling, right?

847
00:56:12,142 --> 00:56:14,627
Ki-jung, some water?

848
00:56:14,728 --> 00:56:16,862
Telepathy... thank you.

849
00:56:39,002 --> 00:56:40,594
Whoa.

850
00:56:42,756 --> 00:56:45,766
Wow, all these
varieties or alcohol.

851
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:50,245
Dad! Let me add
another to the mix!

852
00:56:50,346 --> 00:56:54,858
This is pretty classy.

853
00:56:55,393 --> 00:57:00,547
Rain falling on the lawn,
as we sip our whiskey...

854
00:57:00,648 --> 00:57:05,369
Ki-woo, what's that yellow
notebook you've been carrying?

855
00:57:06,029 --> 00:57:09,473
This? It's Da-hye's diary.

856
00:57:09,574 --> 00:57:11,058
Her diary?

857
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:15,420
What a scumbag.
How could you read her diary?

858
00:57:15,955 --> 00:57:21,235
Just so we can
understand each other deeper.

859
00:57:21,336 --> 00:57:24,054
Fuck, are you two dating?

860
00:57:24,214 --> 00:57:28,683
I'm serious.
She really likes me too.

861
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,062
Awhile back...

862
00:57:33,098 --> 00:57:34,356
Never mind.

863
00:57:35,391 --> 00:57:38,293
When she enters university.
I'll officially ask her out.

864
00:57:38,394 --> 00:57:39,778
Seriously.

865
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:46,410
My son!

866
00:57:46,569 --> 00:57:51,164
Then this house will be
your in-laws' house?

867
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,560
That's right.

868
00:57:54,661 --> 00:57:58,480
Fuck, then I'm washing dishes
at my daughter-in-law's?

869
00:57:58,581 --> 00:58:02,259
Sure, washing your
daughter-in-law's socks!

870
00:58:13,805 --> 00:58:19,251
I like her.
She's a good kid.

871
00:58:19,352 --> 00:58:23,655
She's pretty,
but she's not wild.

872
00:58:24,691 --> 00:58:28,869
Well, now that
we're daydreaming...

873
00:58:29,946 --> 00:58:32,556
If Da-hye and I marry,

874
00:58:32,657 --> 00:58:36,501
we can bring in actors
to be my mom and dad.

875
00:58:37,479 --> 00:58:38,479
Look at her.

876
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,441
She got so many jobs
acting in weddings last year.

877
00:58:42,542 --> 00:58:46,862
even caught the bouquet
from a bitch I've never met.

878
00:58:46,963 --> 00:58:49,948
If you get the bouquet,
they pay an extra $10.

879
00:58:50,049 --> 00:58:52,076
That's how your acting
got so good!

880
00:58:52,177 --> 00:58:57,664
Acting is one thing, but this
family is so gullible, right?

881
00:58:57,765 --> 00:58:59,958
The madame especially.

882
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:02,068
You said it.

883
00:59:03,605 --> 00:59:07,174
She's so naive,
and nice.

884
00:59:07,275 --> 00:59:09,176
She's rich, but still nice.

885
00:59:09,277 --> 00:59:11,637
Not "rich, but still nice."

886
00:59:11,738 --> 00:59:15,665
"Nice because she's rich."
You know?

887
00:59:16,201 --> 00:59:22,714
Hell, if I had all this money.

888
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:27,653
I'd be nice too!

889
00:59:27,754 --> 00:59:29,262
Even nicer!

890
00:59:29,422 --> 00:59:31,740
That's true.
Your mom's right

891
00:59:31,841 --> 00:59:34,243
Rich people are naive.
No resentments.

892
00:59:34,344 --> 00:59:36,620
No creases on them.

893
00:59:36,721 --> 00:59:40,124
It all gets ironed out.
Money is an iron.

894
00:59:40,225 --> 00:59:42,626
Those creases all get smoothed out.

895
00:59:42,727 --> 00:59:44,277
Hey, Ki-woo.

896
00:59:44,896 --> 00:59:49,950
You know that driver, Yoon?
Was it Yoon?

897
00:59:50,485 --> 00:59:52,719
The driver before me.

898
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,012
Yeah, Yoon.

899
00:59:54,113 --> 00:59:58,684
He must be working
somewhere else now, right?

900
00:59:58,785 --> 01:00:01,103
Sure, he must be.

901
01:00:01,204 --> 01:00:04,798
He's young,
got a nice physique.

902
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:08,402
He must've found a better job.

903
01:00:08,503 --> 01:00:10,595
Fucking hell!

904
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:13,615
What's with her now?

905
01:00:13,716 --> 01:00:20,188
We're the ones who need help.
Worry about us, okay?

906
01:00:20,306 --> 01:00:23,709
Dad! Come on, Dad!

907
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:28,130
Just focus on us, okay?
On us!

908
01:00:28,231 --> 01:00:32,551
Not Driver Yoon, but me, please.

909
01:00:32,652 --> 01:00:34,887
Awesome timing, huh?

910
01:00:34,988 --> 01:00:39,082
She speaks,
and the lightning crashes!

911
01:00:40,743 --> 01:00:43,837
Hey, Jessica. Cheers.

912
01:00:44,872 --> 01:00:50,319
Hey, when I went up before,
and you were in the bath...

913
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,345
What about it?

914
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,283
How to put it?
You fit in here.

915
01:00:56,384 --> 01:00:59,019
This rich house suits you.
Not like us.

916
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,120
Fuck off.

917
01:01:00,221 --> 01:01:01,079
I'm serious!

918
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:02,831
Dad, before...

919
01:01:02,932 --> 01:01:05,817
She was lying back in the tub,
watching TV.

920
01:01:06,352 --> 01:01:08,903
Like she's lived here for years.

921
01:01:10,481 --> 01:01:16,428
Speaking of which,
if this became our house,

922
01:01:16,529 --> 01:01:20,766
if we lived here,
which room would you want?

923
01:01:20,867 --> 01:01:26,063
What room in this masterwork
by the great Namgoong?

924
01:01:26,164 --> 01:01:28,023
Fuck, I don't know.

925
01:01:28,124 --> 01:01:31,926
Get me the house first.
Then I'll think about it.

926
01:01:32,462 --> 01:01:34,596
We live here now, don't we?

927
01:01:35,131 --> 01:01:38,933
Getting drunk in the living room.

928
01:01:39,052 --> 01:01:41,787
Right, we live here.
Why not?

929
01:01:41,888 --> 01:01:46,541
This is our home right now.
It's cosy.

930
01:01:46,642 --> 01:01:49,628
Cosy?
Are you feeling cosy?

931
01:01:49,729 --> 01:01:54,824
Sure, but suppose Park
walked through that door now.

932
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,677
What about your dad?

933
01:01:56,778 --> 01:02:00,413
He'd run and hide
like a cockroach.

934
01:02:00,948 --> 01:02:03,100
Kids, you know at our house,

935
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:08,939
when you turn on the light,
and the cockroaches scatter?

936
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,924
You know what I mean?

937
01:02:11,501 --> 01:02:14,844
I'm getting fucking tired of this.

938
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:17,263
- A cockroach?
- Yeah.

939
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:22,661
Huh? What's wrong?

940
01:02:22,762 --> 01:02:23,870
What's the matter?

941
01:02:23,971 --> 01:02:27,982
Dad, don't do that.
You only live once.

942
01:02:35,024 --> 01:02:36,717
What the hell?

943
01:02:36,818 --> 01:02:38,427
I fooled you! Didn't I?

944
01:02:38,528 --> 01:02:39,845
Jesus, Dad.

945
01:02:39,946 --> 01:02:44,016
I fooled you too, Ki-woo?
Did it look for real?

946
01:02:44,117 --> 01:02:47,811
If it was for real,
I'd fucking kill you.

947
01:02:47,912 --> 01:02:51,965
What is this?
Fucking puppy.

948
01:02:57,505 --> 01:02:59,740
Who is it at this hour'?

949
01:02:59,841 --> 01:03:01,725
What is it?

950
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:08,999
What's she doing here?

951
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,193
The old housekeeper?

952
01:03:12,728 --> 01:03:14,571
What's she here for?

953
01:03:15,106 --> 01:03:18,992
She won't stop ringing it.

954
01:03:20,027 --> 01:03:22,912
Raising a racket.

955
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:24,890
Who is it?

956
01:03:24,991 --> 01:03:29,811
Oh, hello! I'm...

957
01:03:29,912 --> 01:03:31,521
The madame's not in, right?

958
01:03:31,622 --> 01:03:32,522
What?

959
01:03:32,623 --> 01:03:37,218
I worked here
for a very long time.

960
01:03:37,753 --> 01:03:43,283
Above the monitor there,
you see a photo of 3 dogs, right?

961
01:03:43,384 --> 01:03:44,826
Zoome, Berry, Foofoo.

962
01:03:44,927 --> 01:03:49,456
I get it,
but why are you here?

963
01:03:49,557 --> 01:03:54,194
You're my successor
as housekeeper, right?

964
01:03:59,233 --> 01:04:00,992
Anyway...

965
01:04:01,527 --> 01:04:04,805
I'm very sorry to
call on you so late.

966
01:04:04,906 --> 01:04:06,790
It's just that...

967
01:04:07,325 --> 01:04:14,088
I forgot something in the
basement under the kitchen.

968
01:04:14,624 --> 01:04:21,012
When I left,
they pushed me out so quickly...

969
01:04:24,091 --> 01:04:26,267
Would you let me in?

970
01:04:28,304 --> 01:04:30,396
What do we do?

971
01:04:30,932 --> 01:04:33,191
This isn't in the plan.

972
01:04:40,733 --> 01:04:42,450
Sorry for the trouble.

973
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:44,010
This way.

974
01:04:44,111 --> 01:04:45,745
Yes, thank you.

975
01:04:47,782 --> 01:04:49,724
You can put your raincoat...

976
01:04:49,825 --> 01:04:52,418
It'll just be a second.

977
01:04:52,995 --> 01:04:56,648
Quite a meal there.
That'll be a job to clean up.

978
01:04:56,749 --> 01:05:00,134
But what did you leave below?

979
01:05:04,674 --> 01:05:07,267
Want to come down with me?

980
01:05:08,302 --> 01:05:11,646
Well, just go ahead.

981
01:06:04,734 --> 01:06:08,077
Help me push this!

982
01:06:08,195 --> 01:06:10,680
Pull it! From over there.

983
01:06:10,781 --> 01:06:12,349
What?

984
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:13,550
Pull!

985
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:17,921
Pull it hard!

986
01:06:21,459 --> 01:06:22,967
Are you okay?

987
01:06:24,503 --> 01:06:25,803
Did I scare you?

988
01:06:28,341 --> 01:06:29,891
Thank you!

989
01:06:30,968 --> 01:06:32,393
Thank you.

990
01:06:40,378 --> 01:06:41,378
Honey!

991
01:06:41,479 --> 01:06:42,612
What the hell?

992
01:06:44,148 --> 01:06:45,215
Hey!

993
01:06:45,316 --> 01:06:46,866
Honey!

994
01:06:47,902 --> 01:06:49,452
Honey!

995
01:06:51,847 --> 01:06:52,847
Wait!

996
01:06:52,948 --> 01:06:55,141
Honey, I'm here!

997
01:06:55,242 --> 01:06:56,542
What is all this?

998
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,180
Honey!

999
01:07:00,456 --> 01:07:02,107
Honey, I'm fine.

1000
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:03,967
No you're not!

1001
01:07:04,068 --> 01:07:05,068
I'm fine, really.

1002
01:07:05,169 --> 01:07:06,403
How can you say that?

1003
01:07:06,504 --> 01:07:08,280
But I'm really hungry.

1004
01:07:08,381 --> 01:07:09,281
Suck it!

1005
01:07:09,382 --> 01:07:12,617
How many days has it been?

1006
01:07:12,718 --> 01:07:14,435
You must've been so hungry!

1007
01:07:16,472 --> 01:07:17,747
It's okay.

1008
01:07:17,848 --> 01:07:20,542
She's a nice woman.
She let me in

1009
01:07:20,643 --> 01:07:22,752
There was an iron plate,
for grilling meat

1010
01:07:22,853 --> 01:07:24,296
It was wedged under the shelf.

1011
01:07:24,397 --> 01:07:25,463
So that's why.

1012
01:07:25,564 --> 01:07:28,967
I couldn't open it from the inside.

1013
01:07:29,068 --> 01:07:32,578
- What's going on here?
- I know you must be startled.

1014
01:07:32,697 --> 01:07:35,289
I would be too in this situation.

1015
01:07:35,408 --> 01:07:39,936
But as two fellow workers...
Right, Chung-sook?

1016
01:07:40,037 --> 01:07:42,880
How do you know my name?

1017
01:07:43,416 --> 01:07:48,111
To be honest I'm still texting
with the boy Da-song.

1018
01:07:48,212 --> 01:07:52,782
I knew they were going camping,
so I came today.

1019
01:07:52,883 --> 01:07:55,660
I wanted to speak to you alone.

1020
01:07:55,761 --> 01:07:56,936
Talking about.

1021
01:07:59,473 --> 01:08:01,791
Don't worry, Chung-sook.

1022
01:08:01,892 --> 01:08:05,629
I cut the wire
on the CCTV by the gate.

1023
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:09,341
Nobody knows I came.
Isn't that good, sis?

1024
01:08:09,442 --> 01:08:11,509
Don't call me sis!

1025
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:14,579
Sis, my name is Moon-gwang.

1026
01:08:15,114 --> 01:08:19,184
This is my hubbie Oh Geun-sae.
Say hello, honey.

1027
01:08:19,285 --> 01:08:22,604
This tastes great.
What happened to your face?

1028
01:08:22,705 --> 01:08:25,548
I'll tell you later.

1029
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:30,028
So you'd steal food every day
while working in the kitchen.

1030
01:08:30,129 --> 01:08:31,154
Feeding your husband.

1031
01:08:31,255 --> 01:08:35,909
Not at all! I bought
all his food with my salary.

1032
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:39,079
That's so unfair!

1033
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:41,790
But how long has
your husband been down here?

1034
01:08:41,891 --> 01:08:44,734
Hold on a sec.
4 years?

1035
01:08:45,269 --> 01:08:47,921
4 years, 3 months
and 17 days.

1036
01:08:48,022 --> 01:08:49,989
Right, it's June now.

1037
01:08:50,524 --> 01:08:56,412
Four years ago when
Mr. Namgoong moved to Paris,

1038
01:08:56,572 --> 01:08:59,582
in the time before
Mr. Park's family moved in,

1039
01:08:59,742 --> 01:09:03,186
I brought my husband down here.

1040
01:09:03,287 --> 01:09:08,316
Many rich houses have secret bunkers,
where you can hide

1041
01:09:08,417 --> 01:09:12,946
in case North Korea attacks,
or if creditors break in.

1042
01:09:13,047 --> 01:09:19,227
But it seems Mr. Namgoong was
a bit embarrassed about this,

1043
01:09:19,386 --> 01:09:23,248
because he never mentioned it
to Mr. Park's family.

1044
01:09:23,349 --> 01:09:24,666
So only I know about it.

1045
01:09:24,767 --> 01:09:27,252
So that’s how it happened.

1046
01:09:27,353 --> 01:09:31,464
But now that I know, I've no
choice but to call the police!

1047
01:09:31,565 --> 01:09:33,991
No please, sis!

1048
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:36,886
As fellow members
of the needy, please don't.

1049
01:09:36,987 --> 01:09:38,388
I'm not needy!

1050
01:09:38,489 --> 01:09:42,267
But we're needy!

1051
01:09:42,368 --> 01:09:46,855
We've no house, no money,
only debts!

1052
01:09:46,956 --> 01:09:48,106
Sis, please!

1053
01:09:48,207 --> 01:09:52,652
Even after 4 years of hiding,
those debt collectors won't give up.

1054
01:09:52,753 --> 01:09:56,906
They're still searching for him,
threatening to stab him.

1055
01:09:57,007 --> 01:09:58,808
You used loan sharks?

1056
01:09:59,468 --> 01:10:01,686
It's all my fault.

1057
01:10:02,221 --> 01:10:03,521
The Taiwan cake shop.

1058
01:10:04,056 --> 01:10:07,834
My Taiwanese Wangshui
castella shop went bust.

1059
01:10:07,935 --> 01:10:10,211
I was overwhelmed by debt.

1060
01:10:10,312 --> 01:10:12,071
Please take this.

1061
01:10:12,189 --> 01:10:13,573
What's that?

1062
01:10:14,108 --> 01:10:17,969
It's not much,
just a modest sum.

1063
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:21,056
But we'll send it
to you every month.

1064
01:10:21,157 --> 01:10:22,891
In return,
just once every 2 days.

1065
01:10:22,992 --> 01:10:26,461
please leave him some food.

1066
01:10:26,996 --> 01:10:30,006
No no, just once a week.

1067
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:32,734
There's a refrigerator here.
Just once a week.

1068
01:10:32,835 --> 01:10:35,278
You've got some nerve!
I'm calling the police.

1069
01:10:35,379 --> 01:10:36,596
Sis!

1070
01:10:39,633 --> 01:10:40,850
Who is that?

1071
01:10:43,888 --> 01:10:45,771
Wait... Jessica?

1072
01:10:46,307 --> 01:10:47,332
Mr. Kim?

1073
01:10:47,433 --> 01:10:48,533
What the hell?

1074
01:10:50,019 --> 01:10:51,086
Dad, my ankle!

1075
01:10:51,187 --> 01:10:52,378
You okay? Sorry.

1076
01:10:52,479 --> 01:10:54,380
Dad, my foot.

1077
01:10:54,481 --> 01:10:56,157
Don't call me Dad!

1078
01:11:03,699 --> 01:11:07,502
I thought it was weird
when the driver was fired.

1079
01:11:07,728 --> 01:11:08,728
Hey.

1080
01:11:08,829 --> 01:11:11,272
- Let's talk things over.
- What the hell?

1081
01:11:11,373 --> 01:11:12,732
Are you some
family of charlatans?

1082
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:13,650
So, sis...

1083
01:11:13,751 --> 01:11:16,260
Don't fucking call me sis,
you filthy bitch!

1084
01:11:16,795 --> 01:11:21,574
I'm gonna send this video
to the madame, how about that?

1085
01:11:21,675 --> 01:11:23,868
Dad, my foot.

1086
01:11:23,969 --> 01:11:26,187
No reception in
the basement, right?

1087
01:11:26,722 --> 01:11:28,581
- The phone works fine.
- Fuck.

1088
01:11:28,682 --> 01:11:33,294
Ma'am, to be honest,
the jobs we have here...

1089
01:11:33,395 --> 01:11:36,422
Shut up!
It's too late now!

1090
01:11:36,523 --> 01:11:39,759
Let's all go to jail!
We're fucking going down!

1091
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:43,371
Lady, are you crazy?

1092
01:11:43,906 --> 01:11:48,893
If they see that video, Mr. Park
and his wife will be so shocked!

1093
01:11:48,994 --> 01:11:52,380
What did those nice people
ever do wrong?

1094
01:11:52,731 --> 01:11:53,731
Why do this to them?

1095
01:11:53,832 --> 01:11:55,525
Stop right there!

1096
01:11:55,626 --> 01:11:57,986
Or I'll push the 'send' button.

1097
01:11:58,087 --> 01:12:00,054
Follow me.

1098
01:12:00,589 --> 01:12:03,015
Calm down, ma'am.

1099
01:12:06,553 --> 01:12:08,604
Don't push!

1100
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,148
Let's go up, honey.

1101
01:12:11,684 --> 01:12:14,569
Time for you
to get some fresh air!

1102
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:37,925
Honey, this 'send' button
is like a missile launcher.

1103
01:12:38,085 --> 01:12:39,844
What do you mean, honey?

1104
01:12:40,421 --> 01:12:45,700
If we threaten to push it.
those people can't do anything.

1105
01:12:45,801 --> 01:12:50,313
It's like a North Korean rocket.
A North Korean missile button!

1106
01:12:51,849 --> 01:12:55,293
Today our beloved
Great Leader Kim Jong-un,

1107
01:12:55,394 --> 01:12:58,463
after witnessing the
charlatan family video,

1108
01:12:58,564 --> 01:13:01,299
was unable to contain
his shock and fury

1109
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,636
at their wicked,
despicable provocation!

1110
01:13:04,737 --> 01:13:06,512
I've missed your jokes, honey!

1111
01:13:06,613 --> 01:13:11,142
Therefore our Great Leader,
in this age of denuclearization,

1112
01:13:11,243 --> 01:13:17,023
has commanded that the nation's
last remaining nuclear warhead

1113
01:13:17,124 --> 01:13:19,609
be driven down the throats
of this wicked family!

1114
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:24,405
No one can imitate North Korean
news anchors like you!

1115
01:13:24,506 --> 01:13:29,535
With their stinking guts serving
as the last nuclear graveyard,

1116
01:13:29,636 --> 01:13:34,540
our Dear Leaders wish to denuclearize
and bring world peace can...

1117
01:13:34,641 --> 01:13:36,651
Hands in the air, fuckers!

1118
01:13:37,186 --> 01:13:38,319
Higher!

1119
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:42,257
You scumbag family.

1120
01:13:42,358 --> 01:13:43,432
Husband?

1121
01:13:43,533 --> 01:13:44,342
Husband.

1122
01:13:44,443 --> 01:13:45,226
Wife?

1123
01:13:45,327 --> 01:13:46,177
Yes.

1124
01:13:46,278 --> 01:13:47,278
Son?

1125
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:48,145
Yes.

1126
01:13:48,246 --> 01:13:49,305
- Daughter?
- Daughter.

1127
01:13:49,406 --> 01:13:51,349
You neanderthals.

1128
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:55,812
Is that all you can think to do,
drink yourselves stupid?

1129
01:13:55,913 --> 01:14:01,192
In this home suffused with
Mr. Namgoong's creative spirit?

1130
01:14:01,293 --> 01:14:02,318
You cretins!

1131
01:14:02,419 --> 01:14:03,736
What do you know about art?

1132
01:14:03,837 --> 01:14:06,097
What would they know?

1133
01:14:06,757 --> 01:14:14,680
When the sun was nice,
we'd bask in those sunbeam, right?

1134
01:14:15,516 --> 01:14:20,152
At such moments we could feel
his artistic touch.

1135
01:15:08,026 --> 01:15:11,537
Give it to me!

1136
01:15:30,591 --> 01:15:34,101
Good job! Delete it!

1137
01:15:35,137 --> 01:15:37,730
Careful, don't send it
by accident.

1138
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:53,379
Hello?

1139
01:15:53,906 --> 01:15:57,416
Listen, do you know how
to make ram-don?

1140
01:15:57,951 --> 01:15:59,185
Ram-don?

1141
01:15:59,286 --> 01:16:02,963
Da-song likes ram-don
more than anything.

1142
01:16:03,123 --> 01:16:06,818
If you boil the water now,
the timing will be perfect.

1143
01:16:06,919 --> 01:16:09,654
There's sirloin in the fridge,
add that too.

1144
01:16:09,755 --> 01:16:11,280
Then, the camping...?

1145
01:16:11,381 --> 01:16:15,100
My god, what a disaster.

1146
01:16:15,636 --> 01:16:20,898
The river overflowed and
everyone was packing their tents,

1147
01:16:21,016 --> 01:16:24,043
but Da-song was crying and
refusing to go home.

1148
01:16:24,144 --> 01:16:28,280
Anyway, ram-don
as soon as we walk in, okay?

1149
01:16:28,398 --> 01:16:30,883
Then you're almost here?

1150
01:16:30,984 --> 01:16:33,536
8 minutes,
according to the GPS.

1151
01:16:33,929 --> 01:16:34,929
You arrive in 8 minutes...

1152
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:38,749
Start boiling
the water right away!

1153
01:16:42,788 --> 01:16:44,505
What the hell is ram-don?

1154
01:16:53,549 --> 01:16:55,349
Move, quickly!

1155
01:16:57,135 --> 01:16:58,235
Hurry!

1156
01:17:05,102 --> 01:17:07,069
Ramen / Udon

1157
01:17:08,605 --> 01:17:11,657
Dad, I can't drag her
any further!

1158
01:17:22,703 --> 01:17:24,587
What are you doing?

1159
01:17:25,706 --> 01:17:27,548
Dad!

1160
01:17:30,586 --> 01:17:33,804
Go up quickly!
Help upstairs.

1161
01:17:41,346 --> 01:17:42,446
Take this!

1162
01:18:01,783 --> 01:18:02,975
Welcome home!

1163
01:18:03,076 --> 01:18:06,420
Da-song, look!
Let's eat ram-don!

1164
01:18:08,582 --> 01:18:10,090
Da-song!

1165
01:18:12,711 --> 01:18:14,720
Da-song!

1166
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:22,645
Madame!

1167
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:43,099
Why don't you just
eat the ram-don?

1168
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:43,975
Shall I?

1169
01:18:44,076 --> 01:18:47,144
No, wait.
I can give it to my husband.

1170
01:18:47,245 --> 01:18:49,338
There's sirloin in here.

1171
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:55,636
It's cooked through?
Medium well done.

1172
01:19:20,696 --> 01:19:26,601
Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!

1173
01:19:26,702 --> 01:19:33,215
Home from the office,
Mr. Park is off duty now.

1174
01:19:34,876 --> 01:19:39,155
Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!

1175
01:19:39,256 --> 01:19:41,348
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

1176
01:19:52,894 --> 01:19:55,296
Honey, do you want
some ram-don?

1177
01:19:55,397 --> 01:19:56,422
Da-song doesn't want it?

1178
01:19:56,523 --> 01:19:57,173
No.

1179
01:19:57,274 --> 01:19:59,199
No, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

1180
01:19:59,735 --> 01:20:02,494
Why are you staring?

1181
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:07,016
Mr. Park, you feed me
and house me.

1182
01:20:07,117 --> 01:20:08,625
Respect!

1183
01:20:10,662 --> 01:20:12,337
You do this every day?

1184
01:20:12,873 --> 01:20:18,343
Sure, I even send whole
sentences to thank him.

1185
01:20:18,879 --> 01:20:20,988
Someone of your age
should know it.

1186
01:20:21,089 --> 01:20:21,947
Know what?

1187
01:20:22,048 --> 01:20:23,849
Morse Code.

1188
01:20:24,426 --> 01:20:28,437
That sensor's going batty.

1189
01:20:36,605 --> 01:20:40,132
Da-song will know it,
since he's a Scout.

1190
01:20:40,233 --> 01:20:41,926
It's ridiculous, right?

1191
01:20:42,027 --> 01:20:45,513
Running around.
trying to please a kid.

1192
01:20:45,614 --> 01:20:47,598
He's not some kind of prince.

1193
01:20:47,699 --> 01:20:50,459
He's the youngest.
It's common.

1194
01:20:51,495 --> 01:20:53,003
Please understand.

1195
01:20:53,538 --> 01:20:57,299
Da-song's a bit... unwell.

1196
01:20:57,542 --> 01:21:00,594
He's receiving trauma therapy
and art therapy.

1197
01:21:01,505 --> 01:21:03,531
There was an incident.

1198
01:21:03,632 --> 01:21:05,015
What incident?

1199
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:09,228
Sis, you believe in ghosts, too?

1200
01:21:10,347 --> 01:21:14,274
Da-song saw a ghost in the house
when he was in 1st grade.

1201
01:21:20,816 --> 01:21:23,217
He had a birthday party
at home that day.

1202
01:21:23,318 --> 01:21:25,761
Late that night,
when everyone was sleeping,

1203
01:21:25,862 --> 01:21:30,433
Da-song crept down to the kitchen
and took the cake out.

1204
01:21:30,534 --> 01:21:33,602
The whipped cream
on that cake was amazing.

1205
01:21:33,703 --> 01:21:36,630
Even in bed, he couldn't
stop thinking about it.

1206
01:21:37,165 --> 01:21:42,553
So Da-song was sitting,
eating his cake...

1207
01:21:52,097 --> 01:21:55,065
He screamed,
and I ran downstairs,

1208
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,568
and he was all...

1209
01:21:58,103 --> 01:22:03,448
his eyes rolled back in his head,
convulsions, foam in his mouth.

1210
01:22:05,485 --> 01:22:07,720
Have you ever seen a child
have a seizure?

1211
01:22:07,821 --> 01:22:08,554
No.

1212
01:22:08,655 --> 01:22:13,934
They need 15-minute treatment,
or they're done for.

1213
01:22:14,035 --> 01:22:19,214
That's the time you have to reach
an emergency room, 15 minutes.

1214
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:24,987
How can you live
in a place like this?

1215
01:22:25,088 --> 01:22:28,282
Well, lots of people
live underground.

1216
01:22:28,383 --> 01:22:30,284
Especially if you count
semi-basements.

1217
01:22:30,385 --> 01:22:34,980
What'll you do?
You don't have a plan?

1218
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:38,775
I just feel comfortable here.

1219
01:22:39,853 --> 01:22:43,071
It feels like I was born here.

1220
01:22:43,732 --> 01:22:47,009
Maybe I had
my wedding here, too.

1221
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:50,537
As for the National Pension,
I don't qualify.

1222
01:22:51,656 --> 01:22:55,292
In my old age,
love will comfort me.

1223
01:22:56,828 --> 01:23:02,216
So please.
Let me live down here.

1224
01:23:03,752 --> 01:23:05,469
Anyway...

1225
01:23:06,004 --> 01:23:11,058
My husband was away on business,
so I had to deal with it all.

1226
01:23:11,676 --> 01:23:15,996
Since then we've always
gone out for his birthday.

1227
01:23:16,097 --> 01:23:19,124
Last year my mother's house,
this year, camping.

1228
01:23:19,225 --> 01:23:24,088
Da-song's dad says it's
just a part of growing up.

1229
01:23:24,189 --> 01:23:29,034
They say a ghost in the
house brings wealth.

1230
01:23:30,195 --> 01:23:35,207
Actually, the money's
been good recently.

1231
01:24:01,768 --> 01:24:03,819
Thank god.

1232
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:33,307
Just stay here for now.

1233
01:24:43,893 --> 01:24:45,944
Zoonie, what's wrong?

1234
01:24:47,981 --> 01:24:49,489
Something under there?

1235
01:24:51,067 --> 01:24:52,826
What is it?

1236
01:24:53,862 --> 01:24:55,078
Damn it!

1237
01:24:56,614 --> 01:24:57,640
- Mom!
- Yeah?

1238
01:24:57,741 --> 01:25:00,142
- How could you?
- What?

1239
01:25:00,243 --> 01:25:04,363
I like ram-don too!
How could you not even ask me?

1240
01:25:04,464 --> 01:25:05,189
Well...

1241
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:09,360
Da-song didn't want it, so you
asked Dad, then ate it yourself.

1242
01:25:09,461 --> 01:25:10,277
Want her to make one?

1243
01:25:10,378 --> 01:25:12,279
That's not the point!

1244
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:16,075
- Stop fighting over ramen!
- Why didn't you ask me?

1245
01:25:16,176 --> 01:25:19,686
Oh, stop it! Just go to bed
Go get changed.

1246
01:25:23,266 --> 01:25:24,858
This way!

1247
01:25:27,353 --> 01:25:30,614
Under there! Hurry!

1248
01:25:33,777 --> 01:25:36,095
One, two, three! One two three!

1249
01:25:36,196 --> 01:25:37,638
Da-song?

1250
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:40,457
Da-song, cut it out!

1251
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:43,460
He's gone crazy!
Get an umbrella.

1252
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:45,128
Hey Park Da-song!

1253
01:25:46,664 --> 01:25:51,443
What a monster.
What the hell is he doing?

1254
01:25:51,544 --> 01:25:55,322
Da-song, it’s time for bed!
You know how late it is?

1255
01:25:55,423 --> 01:25:56,523
Here.

1256
01:25:57,467 --> 01:25:58,767
Honey, here.

1257
01:26:02,347 --> 01:26:09,027
Who do you take after to be
so stubborn! Look at this rain!

1258
01:26:14,567 --> 01:26:17,411
OMG Kevin.
Da-song camping in the yard.

1259
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:25,419
Hey, channel 3 for emergencies!
Keep it turned on.

1260
01:26:25,995 --> 01:26:29,189
Let me have it.
I can't believe him

1261
01:26:29,290 --> 01:26:31,925
Just leave him.
He'll come in if he's tired.

1262
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:35,120
- I want you here, honey.
- I'm with you.

1263
01:26:35,221 --> 01:26:36,196
Hey, Da-hye!

1264
01:26:36,297 --> 01:26:38,890
Stop using your phone.
Go to bed.

1265
01:26:39,425 --> 01:26:41,869
Go sleep in your room.
We'll take care of things.

1266
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:44,997
This is the living room,
do you copy?

1267
01:26:45,098 --> 01:26:46,206
Copy, over.

1268
01:26:46,307 --> 01:26:50,502
Daddy is standing by
for emergencies, over.

1269
01:26:50,603 --> 01:26:53,363
Got it, over.

1270
01:26:54,399 --> 01:26:56,341
Is that tent going to leak?

1271
01:26:56,442 --> 01:26:59,762
We ordered from the U.S.,
it'll be fine.

1272
01:26:59,863 --> 01:27:02,890
- Should we sleep here?
- What?

1273
01:27:02,991 --> 01:27:05,184
We've got a full view of the tent.

1274
01:27:05,285 --> 01:27:07,144
Good idea.
I'll feel much better.

1275
01:27:07,245 --> 01:27:07,978
Right?

1276
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:10,088
Let’s watch over him as we sleep.

1277
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:13,550
What a kid...

1278
01:27:23,094 --> 01:27:24,311
Wait a minute.

1279
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:28,874
Where's that smell coming from?

1280
01:27:28,975 --> 01:27:30,400
What smell?

1281
01:27:30,935 --> 01:27:32,277
Mr. Kim's smell.

1282
01:27:32,812 --> 01:27:34,196
- Mr. Kim?
- Yeah.

1283
01:27:34,814 --> 01:27:36,173
Not sure what you mean.

1284
01:27:36,274 --> 01:27:39,451
Really?
You must have smelled it.

1285
01:27:39,986 --> 01:27:43,555
That smell that wafts through
the car, how to describe it?

1286
01:27:43,656 --> 01:27:46,016
- An old man's smell?
- No no, it's not that

1287
01:27:46,117 --> 01:27:48,376
What is it?

1288
01:27:48,912 --> 01:27:50,795
Like an old radish?

1289
01:27:51,414 --> 01:27:52,631
No.

1290
01:27:52,749 --> 01:27:54,983
You know when you boil a rag?

1291
01:27:55,084 --> 01:27:56,468
It smells like that.

1292
01:27:59,005 --> 01:28:05,369
Anyway, even though he always
seems about to cross the line,

1293
01:28:05,470 --> 01:28:08,705
he never does cross it.
That's good.

1294
01:28:08,806 --> 01:28:10,440
- I'll give him credit.
- Yeah.

1295
01:28:11,559 --> 01:28:14,319
But that smell crosses the line.

1296
01:28:14,854 --> 01:28:17,072
It powers through
right into the back seat.

1297
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:18,966
How bad can it be?

1298
01:28:19,067 --> 01:28:20,283
I don't know.

1299
01:28:21,319 --> 01:28:23,703
It's hard to describe.

1300
01:28:24,739 --> 01:28:28,183
But you sometimes smell it
on the subway.

1301
01:28:28,284 --> 01:28:31,711
It's been ages
since I rode a subway.

1302
01:28:32,247 --> 01:28:35,190
People who ride the subway
have a special smell.

1303
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:36,716
Yeah.

1304
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:55,902
Isn't this like
the cars back seat?

1305
01:28:56,562 --> 01:29:00,031
What if Da-song comes back in?

1306
01:29:00,566 --> 01:29:02,200
Don't worry!

1307
01:29:02,735 --> 01:29:05,412
I can just pull my hand back.

1308
01:29:10,952 --> 01:29:12,586
We shouldn't...

1309
01:29:19,127 --> 01:29:20,510
Do it clockwise.

1310
01:29:21,045 --> 01:29:22,145
Right.

1311
01:29:25,508 --> 01:29:28,810
You know where.

1312
01:29:45,361 --> 01:29:48,872
You still have those cheap panties?

1313
01:29:49,052 --> 01:29:50,152
Huh?

1314
01:29:50,408 --> 01:29:53,168
The ones Yoon's girlfriend
left behind.

1315
01:29:54,287 --> 01:29:57,380
If you wear those,
I'll get really fucking hard.

1316
01:29:57,915 --> 01:29:59,257
Really?

1317
01:29:59,792 --> 01:30:02,802
Then buy me drugs.

1318
01:30:03,379 --> 01:30:06,973
Buy me drugs!

1319
01:30:08,051 --> 01:30:09,517
Eat this instead.

1320
01:30:21,564 --> 01:30:22,697
You like it?

1321
01:30:43,836 --> 01:30:46,221
They're passed out cold.
Sneak out now.

1322
01:31:20,289 --> 01:31:22,716
Emergency!
Emergency, over!

1323
01:31:25,253 --> 01:31:26,636
- Emergency!
- What?

1324
01:31:27,655 --> 01:31:28,655
What is it, over!

1325
01:31:28,756 --> 01:31:30,324
Da-song, what's wrong?

1326
01:31:30,425 --> 01:31:32,892
I can't sleep, over.

1327
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:36,913
So stop it and come in, okay?

1328
01:31:37,014 --> 01:31:39,666
Go sleep in your soft bed. over

1329
01:31:39,767 --> 01:31:41,084
Right!

1330
01:31:41,185 --> 01:31:43,528
I don't want to. over.

1331
01:31:44,063 --> 01:31:45,488
Hey, Park Da-song.

1332
01:31:50,653 --> 01:31:52,996
Let's just sleep...

1333
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:31,511
How did it turn out back there?

1334
01:33:32,547 --> 01:33:33,647
What?

1335
01:33:35,967 --> 01:33:38,017
The people in the basement.

1336
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:45,108
Well, I tied them up.

1337
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,569
What will we do now?

1338
01:33:48,688 --> 01:33:49,863
Huh?

1339
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:55,577
What do we do now,
what's our plan?

1340
01:33:56,195 --> 01:33:59,289
I've been wondering...

1341
01:34:00,032 --> 01:34:03,418
What would Min do
in this situation?

1342
01:34:04,954 --> 01:34:07,297
Min wouldn't be
in this situation!

1343
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:15,013
Look kids, we made it
out of there safely, right?

1344
01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:21,453
And besides us, nobody knows
what happened there. Right?

1345
01:34:21,554 --> 01:34:24,480
So nothing happened.
You understand?

1346
01:34:25,558 --> 01:34:30,153
I've got my own plan.

1347
01:34:30,688 --> 01:34:34,407
So you two just
forget about it, okay?

1348
01:34:34,942 --> 01:34:36,492
Let's go home.

1349
01:34:37,528 --> 01:34:39,579
Let's go take a bath.

1350
01:34:58,215 --> 01:35:00,725
What are you doing there?
Hurry up!

1351
01:35:14,273 --> 01:35:16,532
What's going on?

1352
01:35:18,653 --> 01:35:21,388
You stay there.
This is all sewage water.

1353
01:35:21,489 --> 01:35:23,915
Was our window open?

1354
01:35:28,454 --> 01:35:31,381
Help me out, Ki-taek!

1355
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:41,015
Ki-woo!

1356
01:35:43,552 --> 01:35:46,521
Hey Ki-woo,
close the window!

1357
01:35:47,556 --> 01:35:49,732
You got shocked?

1358
01:35:56,357 --> 01:35:58,074
I'm dizzy.

1359
01:36:01,654 --> 01:36:05,707
Hold on a sec.
Wait.

1360
01:36:11,247 --> 01:36:13,047
Shit, I'm dizzy.

1361
01:36:17,086 --> 01:36:19,637
Ki-jung, be careful.

1362
01:36:21,173 --> 01:36:22,724
Don't touch anything.

1363
01:36:35,271 --> 01:36:40,925
Honey, I've got a concussion.

1364
01:36:41,026 --> 01:36:43,870
I can't see you.

1365
01:37:04,967 --> 01:37:09,729
Honey, that woman Chung-sook...

1366
01:37:10,264 --> 01:37:12,165
Oh, god.

1367
01:37:12,266 --> 01:37:14,609
What a nice person.

1368
01:37:16,187 --> 01:37:19,614
She kicked me
down the stairs

1369
01:37:22,151 --> 01:37:24,202
Repeat after me.

1370
01:37:24,737 --> 01:37:27,455
Chung-sook...

1371
01:37:28,991 --> 01:37:32,418
Chung-sook...

1372
01:37:41,337 --> 01:37:43,638
Hey, Ki-woo!

1373
01:37:44,423 --> 01:37:46,032
What at are you doing there?

1374
01:37:46,133 --> 01:37:47,233
Huh?

1375
01:38:02,233 --> 01:38:06,369
H O L P... M...

1376
01:39:11,677 --> 01:39:12,894
Dad.

1377
01:39:13,554 --> 01:39:14,854
Yeah?

1378
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:19,609
What was your plan?

1379
01:39:21,186 --> 01:39:23,196
What are you talking about?

1380
01:39:24,231 --> 01:39:26,949
Before, you said you had a plan.

1381
01:39:27,484 --> 01:39:29,452
What will you do?
About...

1382
01:39:30,029 --> 01:39:31,287
the basement.

1383
01:39:32,323 --> 01:39:38,044
Ki-woo, you know what kind
of plan never fails?

1384
01:39:39,622 --> 01:39:42,148
No plan at all.

1385
01:39:42,249 --> 01:39:43,925
No plan.

1386
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:46,010
You know why?

1387
01:39:48,047 --> 01:39:54,727
If you make a plan,
life never works out that way.

1388
01:39:55,262 --> 01:39:56,771
Look around us.

1389
01:39:57,306 --> 01:40:02,944
Did these people think,
"Let's all spend the night in a gym?"

1390
01:40:03,479 --> 01:40:05,446
But look now.

1391
01:40:05,606 --> 01:40:09,617
Everyone's sleeping
on the floor, us included.

1392
01:40:11,153 --> 01:40:14,580
That's why people
shouldn't make plans.

1393
01:40:16,617 --> 01:40:20,395
With no plan,
nothing can go wrong.

1394
01:40:20,496 --> 01:40:27,385
And if something spins out
of control, it doesn't matter.

1395
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:31,389
Whether you kill someone
or betray your country.

1396
01:40:32,925 --> 01:40:36,560
None of it fucking matters.
Got it?

1397
01:40:38,222 --> 01:40:39,689
Dad.

1398
01:40:41,725 --> 01:40:43,317
I'm sorry.

1399
01:40:43,936 --> 01:40:45,778
For what?

1400
01:40:48,816 --> 01:40:50,449
Everything.

1401
01:40:51,110 --> 01:40:52,910
All of it.

1402
01:40:54,947 --> 01:40:57,248
I'll take care of everything.

1403
01:40:57,783 --> 01:41:00,001
What are you talking about?

1404
01:41:02,037 --> 01:41:04,630
Why are you hugging
that stone?

1405
01:41:05,249 --> 01:41:06,966
This?

1406
01:41:12,506 --> 01:41:15,641
It keeps clinging to me.

1407
01:41:17,678 --> 01:41:22,064
I think you need some sleep.

1408
01:41:25,102 --> 01:41:26,694
I'm serious.

1409
01:41:28,230 --> 01:41:30,823
It keeps following me.

1410
01:41:43,871 --> 01:41:45,730
Miss Jessica!
Sorry to call on Sunday morning.

1411
01:41:45,831 --> 01:41:48,191
Are you free for lunch today?

1412
01:41:48,292 --> 01:41:52,053
We're having a birthday
impromptu for Da-song.

1413
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:55,365
A birthday party?

1414
01:41:55,466 --> 01:41:58,893
If you come too,
Da-song will be so happy.

1415
01:41:59,094 --> 01:42:03,230
And have as much pasta, gratin,
and salmon steak as you want.

1416
01:42:03,348 --> 01:42:05,458
Please come by 1PM,

1417
01:42:05,559 --> 01:42:08,670
and I'll count today as
one of your lessons.

1418
01:42:08,771 --> 01:42:11,322
You know what I mean?
See you soon!

1419
01:42:12,566 --> 01:42:14,008
- Mom.
- Yeah?

1420
01:42:14,109 --> 01:42:17,762
For the impromptu,
should we invite Kevin too?

1421
01:42:17,863 --> 01:42:20,640
Great idea! Why not?
Will you call him?

1422
01:42:20,741 --> 01:42:24,644
Get some more sleep, honey!
You must be tired after yesterday.

1423
01:42:24,745 --> 01:42:28,898
If we have a party,
won't you need to do the rounds?

1424
01:42:28,999 --> 01:42:33,386
Right, the wine shop,
supermarket, bakery, florist...

1425
01:42:34,213 --> 01:42:36,847
But I already told Mr. Kim
to hurry over.

1426
01:42:36,965 --> 01:42:38,658
I'll pay him overtime.

1427
01:42:38,759 --> 01:42:39,859
Perfect.

1428
01:42:50,395 --> 01:42:54,073
Everyone it down, I'll explain!

1429
01:42:54,316 --> 01:42:59,995
Da-hye: We're having a party,
and mom said to invite you!

1430
01:43:01,949 --> 01:43:05,268
Sis, in the basement...

1431
01:43:05,369 --> 01:43:07,645
we have 10 outdoor tables.

1432
01:43:07,746 --> 01:43:11,632
First take them all out,
then arrange them...

1433
01:43:12,292 --> 01:43:15,511
No, come to the window.
I need to show you.

1434
01:43:17,214 --> 01:43:18,990
With Da-song's tent in the middle,

1435
01:43:19,091 --> 01:43:22,626
curve the tables outward...

1436
01:43:22,727 --> 01:43:24,871
A crane's wing formation!

1437
01:43:24,972 --> 01:43:28,257
Like Admiral Yi used, you know?
The Battle of Hansan Island!

1438
01:43:28,358 --> 01:43:30,918
Think of the tent as
the Japanese warship.

1439
01:43:31,019 --> 01:43:36,299
And our tables will make a
semicircular crane's wing formation.

1440
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:40,595
Then near the tent will be the
barbeque grill, firewood and such.

1441
01:43:40,696 --> 01:43:42,897
Arrange them all there!

1442
01:43:42,998 --> 01:43:46,859
Oh sure,
bring your husband too!

1443
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:47,685
Yeah!

1444
01:43:47,786 --> 01:43:51,755
And definitely no presents,
just come!

1445
01:43:52,624 --> 01:43:54,317
What dress code?

1446
01:43:54,418 --> 01:43:58,053
It's an impromptu.
You can wear sweat pants!

1447
01:43:59,089 --> 01:44:04,852
And definitely no presents!
Just come and eat hors d'oeuvres!

1448
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:07,997
You know my culinary skills!

1449
01:44:08,098 --> 01:44:13,235
Right!
We'll get drunk in the daytime.

1450
01:44:14,813 --> 01:44:18,324
If you'd sing, that'd be grand!
You know the one...

1451
01:44:34,374 --> 01:44:37,176
Quiet, he's sleeping!

1452
01:44:37,711 --> 01:44:40,780
Today the sky's so blue,
and no pollution!

1453
01:44:40,881 --> 01:44:43,057
Thanks to all the rain yesterday.

1454
01:44:44,092 --> 01:44:45,326
Right.

1455
01:44:45,427 --> 01:44:49,522
So we traded camping
for a garden party.

1456
01:44:50,557 --> 01:44:52,358
Lemons into lemonade.

1457
01:44:55,479 --> 01:45:00,533
Right, that rain
was such a blessing!

1458
01:45:02,069 --> 01:45:06,580
And definitely no presents,
I mean it!

1459
01:45:07,115 --> 01:45:11,001
Right, just squeeze your
Mini Cooper into the garage.

1460
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:12,270
Go on up!

1461
01:45:12,371 --> 01:45:17,283
Right, back it in.
Just don't block the Benz!

1462
01:45:17,384 --> 01:45:20,484
You're here!
It's been so long!

1463
01:45:23,507 --> 01:45:25,849
I told you no presents!

1464
01:45:43,902 --> 01:45:46,036
You were thinking of
something else.

1465
01:45:46,196 --> 01:45:47,580
What?

1466
01:45:48,615 --> 01:45:51,792
While kissing me,
you thought of something else.

1467
01:45:53,912 --> 01:45:55,170
No.

1468
01:45:56,206 --> 01:45:59,842
What do you mean?
You're doing it now, too.

1469
01:46:02,379 --> 01:46:03,637
Wow.

1470
01:46:05,257 --> 01:46:07,975
Everyone looks gorgeous, right?

1471
01:46:09,386 --> 01:46:13,147
Even for a sudden gathering,
they're so cool.

1472
01:46:14,016 --> 01:46:16,400
And look so natural.

1473
01:46:18,437 --> 01:46:19,695
Da-hye.

1474
01:46:22,274 --> 01:46:23,907
Do I fit in here?

1475
01:46:25,285 --> 01:46:27,011
What?

1476
01:46:27,946 --> 01:46:30,956
In this setting, do I fit in?

1477
01:46:40,876 --> 01:46:43,093
Hey, where are you going?

1478
01:46:43,628 --> 01:46:44,845
I need to go down.

1479
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:47,389
Just stay with me.

1480
01:46:48,383 --> 01:46:50,309
I need to go down there.

1481
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:55,731
Why go to those boring people?
Can't you stay here?

1482
01:46:56,725 --> 01:47:01,003
Not to those people,
down lover.

1483
01:47:01,104 --> 01:47:04,031
Wow, what is that?

1484
01:47:07,069 --> 01:47:10,954
God, I can't believe
I'm doing this at my age.

1485
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:13,457
It's so embarrassing.

1486
01:47:14,493 --> 01:47:15,935
I'm really sorry, Mr. Kim.

1487
01:47:16,036 --> 01:47:19,230
Da-song's mom insisted,
it can’t be helped.

1488
01:47:19,331 --> 01:47:20,898
But the concept is simple.

1489
01:47:20,999 --> 01:47:26,320
There'll be a parade with
Jessica carrying a birthday cake.

1490
01:47:26,421 --> 01:47:30,408
Then we jump out
and attack Jessica.

1491
01:47:30,509 --> 01:47:32,743
Swinging our tomahawks!

1492
01:47:32,844 --> 01:47:33,619
Right.

1493
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:39,149
Just then, Da-song the good Indian
will jump out and we'll do battle.

1494
01:47:39,309 --> 01:47:43,879
Finally, he'll save Jessica,
the cake princess, and they'll all cheer.

1495
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:45,572
Something like that.

1496
01:47:46,717 --> 01:47:47,717
Silly, isn't it?

1497
01:47:47,818 --> 01:47:52,638
I guess your wife likes
events and surprises.

1498
01:47:52,739 --> 01:47:54,832
Yeah, she does.

1499
01:47:54,991 --> 01:47:57,960
But she's particularly into this party.

1500
01:47:59,496 --> 01:48:02,464
You're trying your best, too.

1501
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:06,468
Well, you love her,
after all.

1502
01:48:12,008 --> 01:48:13,108
Mr. Kim.

1503
01:48:14,761 --> 01:48:17,396
You're getting paid extra.

1504
01:48:22,561 --> 01:48:26,905
Think of this as
part of your work, okay?

1505
01:48:38,201 --> 01:48:39,852
Did you go down below?

1506
01:48:39,953 --> 01:48:43,689
- Not yet.
- Shouldn't we talk to them?

1507
01:48:43,790 --> 01:48:45,608
Reach an understanding?

1508
01:48:45,709 --> 01:48:46,650
Exactly!

1509
01:48:46,751 --> 01:48:49,528
We all got too fucking
worked up last night.

1510
01:48:49,629 --> 01:48:53,557
Dad was going on
about some plan...

1511
01:48:53,967 --> 01:48:56,410
- I'm just going down there.
- Hold on.

1512
01:48:56,511 --> 01:48:58,704
Take this down to them.

1513
01:48:58,805 --> 01:49:00,414
- They must be hungry.
- Right.

1514
01:49:00,515 --> 01:49:02,483
Let them eat first.

1515
01:49:04,394 --> 01:49:06,028
Coffee next time for Sure!

1516
01:49:07,063 --> 01:49:08,798
Here you are, Jessica.

1517
01:49:08,899 --> 01:49:11,258
- This is so amazing.
- Isn't it great?

1518
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:13,844
I've got a special favor to ask.

1519
01:49:13,945 --> 01:49:15,120
What is it?

1520
01:49:15,363 --> 01:49:17,431
This is... how to describe it?

1521
01:49:17,532 --> 01:49:19,475
Da-song's trauma recovery cake?

1522
01:49:19,576 --> 01:49:23,045
So it needs to be you who does it.
Today's highlight!

1523
01:50:45,996 --> 01:50:49,381
Hey, are you okay?

1524
01:50:54,421 --> 01:50:55,929
Are you...?

1525
01:51:05,974 --> 01:51:07,274
Wait, mister!

1526
01:52:54,290 --> 01:52:57,300
Kevin? Kevin!

1527
01:53:03,842 --> 01:53:06,577
Da-song, happy birthday!

1528
01:53:06,678 --> 01:53:08,145
Congratulations!

1529
01:53:15,398 --> 01:53:16,824
Shit...

1530
01:53:26,499 --> 01:53:28,599
Stop!

1531
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:30,809
Chung-sook!

1532
01:53:30,910 --> 01:53:31,685
Ki-jung!

1533
01:53:31,786 --> 01:53:33,395
Come out here, Chung-sook!

1534
01:53:33,496 --> 01:53:36,906
Stop the blood!
Push down on the wound!

1535
01:53:41,368 --> 01:53:42,803
Da-song!

1536
01:53:43,459 --> 01:53:44,678
Honey!

1537
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:47,585
Let go, don't!

1538
01:53:58,936 --> 01:54:00,699
It hurts.

1539
01:54:05,197 --> 01:54:06,387
The emergency room!

1540
01:54:06,488 --> 01:54:08,021
Get the car!

1541
01:54:08,122 --> 01:54:09,665
Mr. Kim!
What are you doing?

1542
01:54:09,766 --> 01:54:11,892
We can't wait for an ambulance!

1543
01:54:11,993 --> 01:54:14,403
Stop pushing, Dad!

1544
01:54:14,504 --> 01:54:17,464
Makes it hurt more.

1545
01:54:18,124 --> 01:54:19,274
Car keys!
The car keys!

1546
01:54:19,375 --> 01:54:22,192
Throw them!
Throw me the key!

1547
01:54:39,812 --> 01:54:41,388
Are you okay?

1548
01:54:41,489 --> 01:54:43,490
Don't touch it!

1549
01:54:45,561 --> 01:54:48,078
Hello, Mr. Park.

1550
01:54:48,196 --> 01:54:49,263
You know me?

1551
01:54:49,364 --> 01:54:51,039
Respect!

1552
01:56:17,702 --> 01:56:21,063
<i>Opening my eyes for
the first time in a month,</i>

1553
01:56:21,164 --> 01:56:22,964
<i>I saw a detective.</i>

1554
01:56:23,124 --> 01:56:27,903
You have the right
to an attorney...

1555
01:56:28,004 --> 01:56:30,305
<i>Who looked nothing
like a detective.</i>

1556
01:56:34,844 --> 01:56:36,537
Is he laughing?

1557
01:56:36,638 --> 01:56:38,313
Just a sec.

1558
01:56:38,723 --> 01:56:43,568
<i>Then the doctor who looked
nothing like a doctor spoke.</i>

1559
01:56:44,604 --> 01:56:48,382
That happens sometimes
after brain surgery.

1560
01:56:48,483 --> 01:56:50,700
They keep laughing.
For no reason.

1561
01:56:51,361 --> 01:56:53,578
Do you hear me?

1562
01:56:53,821 --> 01:56:55,705
Can you hear me?

1563
01:56:55,823 --> 01:56:57,599
Then do I have to do it again?

1564
01:56:57,700 --> 01:56:58,517
Do what?

1565
01:56:58,618 --> 01:57:00,168
The Miranda thing.

1566
01:57:02,705 --> 01:57:06,525
You have the right to remain silent.

1567
01:57:06,626 --> 01:57:09,361
Anything you say can and
will be used against you...

1568
01:57:09,462 --> 01:57:11,846
He keeps laughing, look!

1569
01:57:14,884 --> 01:57:20,981
<i>Even when I heard how much
Ki-jung bled that day...</i>

1570
01:57:23,142 --> 01:57:30,357
<i>Even when I heard the words forgery,
trespassing, foul play, self-defense</i>

1571
01:57:30,608 --> 01:57:34,995
<i>and we were lucky to
get away with a probation...</i>

1572
01:57:38,032 --> 01:57:41,059
<i>Even when I finally
got to see Ki-jung's face...</i>

1573
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:44,170
Kim Ki-jung. RIP

1574
01:57:45,707 --> 01:57:48,008
<i>I kept laughing.</i>

1575
01:57:57,677 --> 01:58:03,165
<i>Still, when I went back and
watched the news reports,</i>

1576
01:58:03,266 --> 01:58:04,458
<i>I didn't laugh.</i>

1577
01:58:04,559 --> 01:58:08,629
This sudden rampage in the
back yard of an upper-class home

1578
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:10,339
is a highly unusual case.

1579
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:14,843
Since the homeless man who sparked
the rampage died at the scene,

1580
01:58:14,944 --> 01:58:20,307
police are struggling to even
establish a clear motive.

1581
01:58:20,408 --> 01:58:24,895
The driver Kim and the slain Mr. Park
are said to have been on good terms.

1582
01:58:24,996 --> 01:58:30,508
For now the police investigation is
focused on locating the driver Kim.

1583
01:58:31,043 --> 01:58:34,780
Kim, after exiting this door
and descending the stairs,

1584
01:58:34,881 --> 01:58:38,391
disappeared into the
neighboring alleys.

1585
01:58:38,926 --> 01:58:44,064
Police searched the CCTVs
of nearby homes to no avail,

1586
01:58:44,599 --> 01:58:47,734
and they have yet
to find any witnesses.

1587
01:58:48,269 --> 01:58:50,337
Given the situation,

1588
01:58:50,438 --> 01:58:55,700
it's not an exaggeration to say
that Kim vanished into thin air.

1589
01:58:56,819 --> 01:59:03,784
<i>Actually Mom and I had
no idea where Dad was.</i>

1590
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:11,800
<i>But those detectives still
wore themselves out tailing us.</i>

1591
01:59:15,838 --> 01:59:21,810
<i>Eventually the news went quiet,
and after the tails stopped,</i>

1592
01:59:22,345 --> 01:59:25,772
<i>I started going up that mountain.</i>

1593
01:59:27,809 --> 01:59:32,529
<i>From up there, you get
a great view of the house.</i>

1594
01:59:35,274 --> 01:59:42,405
<i>That day, despite the cold.
I felt like staying longer.</i>

1595
01:59:55,753 --> 01:59:59,264
Dash-dash-dot-dot

1596
02:00:24,323 --> 02:00:25,707
Son!

1597
02:00:27,743 --> 02:00:29,085
Son!

1598
02:00:31,122 --> 02:00:34,966
<i>Perhaps you, if no one else.
will be able to read this letter.</i>

1599
02:00:38,504 --> 02:00:44,809
<i>You were a Boy Scout,
so I'm writing this just in case.</i>

1600
02:00:47,847 --> 02:00:50,815
<i>Have your injuries healed?</i>

1601
02:00:51,851 --> 02:00:56,154
<i>I'm sure your mom
is plenty healthy.</i>

1602
02:01:00,192 --> 02:01:02,994
<i>I'm doing fine in here.</i>

1603
02:01:04,030 --> 02:01:06,789
<i>Though thinking
of Ki-jung makes me cry.</i>

1604
02:01:09,827 --> 02:01:14,672
<i>Even now, what happened
that day doesn't seem real.</i>

1605
02:01:15,917 --> 02:01:17,634
<i>It feels like a dream,</i>

1606
02:01:19,170 --> 02:01:21,137
<i>and yet it doesn't.</i>

1607
02:01:22,173 --> 02:01:27,143
<i>That day as I went out the gate,
I suddenly knew.</i>

1608
02:01:28,179 --> 02:01:29,938
<i>Where I needed to go...</i>

1609
02:02:09,345 --> 02:02:12,330
<i>A house where such
grisly crime took place</i>

1610
02:02:12,431 --> 02:02:15,692
<i>would surely not
be easy to sell.</i>

1611
02:02:18,813 --> 02:02:21,214
I'm sorry, Mr. Park.

1612
02:02:21,315 --> 02:02:27,870
<i>I struggled to hold out
like that in an empty house.</i>

1613
02:02:30,408 --> 02:02:33,310
<i>Still, thanks to
the house being empty.</i>

1614
02:02:33,411 --> 02:02:38,273
<i>what was her name?
Moon-gwang?</i>

1615
02:02:38,374 --> 02:02:42,677
<i>I was able to give her
a proper send off.</i>

1616
02:02:43,796 --> 02:02:50,560
<i>I hear tree-side burials are trendy.
so hell, I did my best.</i>

1617
02:02:54,098 --> 02:02:57,734
<i>But those real estate sharks
sure are clever.</i>

1618
02:03:02,273 --> 02:03:06,509
<i>They hoodwinked some people
who had just arrived in Korea</i>

1619
02:03:06,610 --> 02:03:08,953
<i>and managed to sell the house.</i>

1620
02:03:10,072 --> 02:03:13,350
<i>With the parents working,
and the kids attending school,</i>

1621
02:03:13,451 --> 02:03:16,044
<i>the family is usually out.</i>

1622
02:03:16,162 --> 02:03:21,591
<i>But the goddamned housekeeper
stays there 24 hours a day.</i>

1623
02:03:21,751 --> 02:03:26,679
<i>Each time I go upstairs,
I take my life in my hands.</i>

1624
02:03:29,216 --> 02:03:33,561
<i>It turns out Germans eat more
than just sausage and beer.</i>

1625
02:03:34,096 --> 02:03:36,147
<i>What a relief.</i>

1626
02:03:38,726 --> 02:03:43,112
<i>Passing the time down here,
everything starts to go hazy.</i>

1627
02:03:47,651 --> 02:03:51,829
<i>Today at least
I was able to write you a letter.</i>

1628
02:03:53,365 --> 02:03:57,268
<i>If I send out the letter
this way every night,</i>

1629
02:03:57,369 --> 02:04:01,839
<i>maybe someday you'll see it.</i>

1630
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:09,931
<i>So long.</i>

1631
02:04:23,479 --> 02:04:24,546
You're home, Ki-woo?

1632
02:04:24,647 --> 02:04:25,747
Yeah.

1633
02:04:40,162 --> 02:04:45,174
<i>Dad, today I made a plan.</i>

1634
02:04:46,710 --> 02:04:48,636
<i>A fundamental plan.</i>

1635
02:04:51,674 --> 02:04:53,349
<i>I'm going to earn money.</i>

1636
02:04:53,926 --> 02:04:55,726
<i>A lot of it.</i>

1637
02:04:59,265 --> 02:05:03,776
<i>University, a career, marriage.
those are all fine,</i>

1638
02:05:03,936 --> 02:05:05,962
<i>but first I'll earn money.</i>

1639
02:05:06,063 --> 02:05:11,409
You'll see once you go in,
but it's very spacious.

1640
02:05:11,944 --> 02:05:16,681
Actually, we don't show
this house to just anyone.

1641
02:05:16,782 --> 02:05:21,294
<i>When I have money,
I'll buy that house.</i>

1642
02:05:22,329 --> 02:05:26,591
<i>On the day we move in,
Mom and I will be in the yard.</i>

1643
02:05:27,126 --> 02:05:29,552
<i>Because the sunshine
is so nice there.</i>

1644
02:05:30,713 --> 02:05:32,763
<i>All you'll need to do</i>

1645
02:05:32,923 --> 02:05:35,808
<i>is walk up the stairs.</i>

1646
02:06:58,425 --> 02:07:02,562
<i>Take care until then.</i>

1647
02:07:07,226 --> 02:07:09,360
<i>So long.</i>
